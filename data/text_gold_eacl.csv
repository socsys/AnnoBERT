f6qe0s,"my biggest fear of cold approach wasn ' t rejection , it was about the judgments of everyone else because it made me question my own value system and identity . i ' ve come to a conclusion which ended up solving the main anxiety that i had for approaching . if a girl rejects me , it doesn ' t really phase me . i just laugh . this has always been the case for me . my biggest issue was with the judgments of those around because of my own life experiences . the reason is because i ' ve lived with women my whole life , so i was left stuck in this weird place where i ' d see the lack of calibration and empathy from pickup infields , and it made me really question my identity in pursuing pickup . i have no room to judge , but that ' s just how i genuinely feel about it . even toddv who seems like a cool dude and one of the better puas , when i ' ve seen some of his older infields , the approaches were very persistent . like it wasn ' t just a "" shit test "" , the girl was straight up like "" fuck off "" and he ' s trying to frame it like she ' s playing hard to get . even if she was , why would you want to be around someone like that ? the chick clearly has issues . it ' s so evident to me because i ' m so used to being around women throughout my life . even back in high school , i was so used to being around women that i ' d be flirting with tons of chicks while thinking that we were just being friendly the whole time . then i ' d have all these chicks into me without knowing how to escalate . the issue is that because i had that perspective , it made things 10x harder since any time i took a risk , it would be a reminder of my experience with sisters and i would project how it would be like if someone approached my sisters in that way . like if my sister was walking in the street and some dude saw her , then ran back all the way just to do a calculated stance in front of her to pick up her up in middle of the street , i would view the dude as a bit weird ngl . and i know that she would too . this isn ' t one of those "" don ' t listen to what girls say , see what they do "" . this isn ' t my sisters who ' d tell me this . this me seeing how they and other girls react to it . and it ' s even obvious in the infield . the girl has uncomfortable af body language , and usually the ones who go with these types of approaches tend to be bar chicks or very insecure and don ' t socially "" get it "" . i ' ve realized that both guys and girls have this , but we have different levels of social awareness . you could pull 1/10 of the chicks you approach , but you ' re pulling in the same way you ' re approaching based on what they ' re willing to accept based on your emotional understanding of the world . there ' s so much more going on behind the scenes . you can still find success in it if you ' re looking for a lay with anyone , but you ' re literally being a gremlin to everyone around and not considering their needs . like for me personally , it ' s straight up lacking in compassion . the only times that it works with an actually cool chick is when the approach is genuine . like you actually give a fuck about who they are . maybe not in a club , but how many of those chicks respect themselves ? not many , from what i ' ve seen . i ' ve been approached by chicks before where they approached in a smooth way and i was into it . they didn ' t say "" excuse me real quick , i think you ' re cute and yada yada yada "" . they would do a cold-read , qualify and gage a bit while having casual body language , then maybe throw in some teasing or flirting or whatever else throughout the interaction . the push-pull happened naturally from them being honest about their likes and dislikes . and they knew how to relate the conversation to the situation at hand . it ' s so natural and they don ' t even feel like strangers anymore . and when i say genuine , i don ' t mean the "" genuine "" that is thrown around with no actual context , but i mean like "" this is me , love it or hate it , who are you , are you in and are you worth it ? "" . now if it was someone in a coffee shop or at a bus stop , where you go in indirectly ( and slowly build up to direct within the same interaction by creating premise ) while building some rapport , then leading into teasing then that ' s a whole other story . even the best salesmen do this . they build some rapport first and then they go for the sale . sure , you need to make the chick nervous , but it ' s the nervousness that comes with a new interaction . just good body language and eye contact creates sexual tension . that seems like normal game . like i ' ve only done a few cold approaches , but there ' s a reason for it . internally , i wasn ' t able to morally justify it . going up and running after a chick to say a direct approach when i don ' t know them is uncalibrated . you can frame it how you want about the "" lucky one who wants a compliment "" , but you ' re basically a salesmen who ' s chasing people around , rather than being calibrated about it . just throwing negs and shit and all this other weird pua bs outside of what ' s taught in "" models "" seems like the guide for someone who ' s never been around women or doesn ' t have that empathy perspective or social awareness . it confuses me when i see people on here who aren ' t aware of it . i ' m not trying to make the awareness of it seem special , but it ' s so clear that it confuses me when the people i see doing pua don ' t notice it . i know i went hard with all that i wrote , but regardless , i ' ll admit that i can ' t come to any conclusion until i actually do at least 100-200 cold approaches . and since i don ' t have asbergers , i trust that i ' ll be able to learn from mistakes rather than just repeat them and blame everyone else but myself . but , i ' m not going to chase after a girl on the street . i ' m either going to approach a chick who ' s stopped , or walking past me ( but not chase after them ) . if a girl has a boyfriend , i ' m also not going to pursue them ( except i might try to continue the convo because i ' m interested in the person ' s perspective or life experiences ) . that way , morally , i can be okay with myself and know that even if others judge me or i get blasted in public , i know that i ' m a compassionate person and that ' s all that matters . this is what stopped me from approaching before . others ' judgments were a reflection on my own lack of respect for myself in doing the typical type of cold approach . tl;dr i realized that i had to try it out before coming to any conclusions . on the other hand , i still think that genuine approach is king . but indirect leading into direct within the same first interaction . not lying , but being aware of the surroundings since they don ' t know me . and approaching in a way that i can be proud of . because if i ' m not proud of it , others ' judgments will always affect me . then , if i get blown out , or people judge me hard , idgaf because i know that i was being considerate and at that point it ' s their issue . if anything , i ' m living rent-free in their head .",1,train

f7nn5m,"pretentious indie game simulatorhi folks , i ' m just your average non-binary/genderfluid/trans/differently-abled/autistic/immigrant indie developer from san francisco . the last few years of my life have been very difficult . people have called me mean names on the internet for voicing my empathetic and well-researched opinion on the benefits of veganism . i received so many death threats and dick pics online that i wasn ' t able to focus on doing my job . i just couldn ' t manage to play and review the latest aaa games for 8 hours everyday . i was very concerned about my life and mental health . so i decided to quit my stressful job working as a part-time writer for a gaming website and moved back to my father ' s mansion in la . it was very hard to go back to a life of solitude after having being used to the chaos of san francisco . while i lived in la , i had the extremely difficult job of catching up on all the backlog of games that i had reviewed at my last job without playing . through this i discovered something about myself . i discovered my passion for copying other people ' s ideas and passing them off as my own . i knew what i had to do . i had to make my own game . it was literally the only way i could make my voice known . i felt validated when my first post about the game got over a thousand likes . i was so proud that my amazing idea resonated with my 15000+ followers on twitter . i knew i was onto something special when all my game journalist friends retweeted all of my 74 blog posts about how difficult it was to learn rpg maker to make this game . the idea was so great that i managed to get the game funded without any sort of marketing at all ! it just goes to show that a good idea is all you need to really create hype around your game . i ' m proud to reveal that i ' ve spent the last 7 months of my life working on my magnum opus . i ' ve put up 3 months of wages on the line into buying the assets for this game . i work on the game all the time . it is so hard to manage with my offshore programming team due to time zone differences . when i ' m not streaming obscure 80s dos games in my pajamas from my bedroom , i am either engaging with the game ' s backers or trying to explain to my programmer who barely speaks english that i want the game to use a custom game engine to build the world ' s most high performance and cross-platform visual novel . i like to make games that express how i really feel inside . i like to express myself online because i can ' t do that in the real world due to my repressed , shy , and introverted personality . this game recounts the first heartbreak in my life when i wasn ' t asked out to the dance by my high school ' s quarterback and instead had to settle for a linebacker . it also deals with my childhood ' s most traumatic horse polo incident . it recalls the liberating feeling when i and my ex-girlfriend simultaneously got our third abortion . it tells the story of a fish out of the water , ignored , who jumps out to discover that the sunshine is just an illusion perpetrated by the capitalist patriarchy . this is my story . this is my voice . this is my soul . game features : monochrome pixel art a protagonist with depression ! lots of walking . cryptic messages . metaphors ! loneliness ! orange man bad ! a whole 8 minutes of gameplay at a reasonable price of $10 .",0,test

fi90pwv,"you might try reading something like feynmans the character of physical law . i thought it gave a good introduction to various concepts without just reciting a bunch of formulas . have you learned any calculus ? i found i understood some things better when i looked at back after learning calculus . beginner physics courses often bypass needing calculus by just giving derived or integrated equations that apply in particular simplified situations , while some get a better understanding by knowing how the given equations were derived . some people also do better when they start thinking about how those concepts apply in day to day life , and are able to get some sense of scale . this is particularly an issue in america where you might be using usc in day to day life but si in the classroom . mathematically , i can work out that a 10 kg block with an applied force of 100 n should have an acceleration of 10 ms^ ( -2 ) . then think about something you can relate that to , 10 ms^ ( -2 ) is about how fast a dense object will fall , 10 kg is a small/medium size dog , or maybe a bag of onions sold at the grocery store , 100 n is about the weight of that dog or onions . highway speeds are around 28 m/s , residential areas might have a speed limit of 11 m/s , a typical walking pace is around 1 . 4 m/s . then if you get a question involving a trolley that has a speed of 2 m/s and applied force of 700 n , you can think of that 700 n being about as hard as you would be able to push something and the 2 m/s as a brisk walk to get an intuitive idea what the result should be before you put pencil to paper . this also helps as a kind of check in that if you make a mistake in your calculation and get a result of something like the trolley weighing 2000 kg you might notice it doesnt fit with your intuition from above . then again , sometimes it comes naturally over time as you start recognizing patterns in the questions , or you start getting more complex questions and have to apply those formulas in more complex ways . sometimes i found my skills grow when i would forget a particular formula while doing a test and work it out from more fundamental ones . for example , i might not have always remembered the quadratic formula but i remembered enough from reading how it was derived to apply the same process to a test question .",0,train

f7y0pt,"until i took the blackpilli thought this was supposed to be a term of enlightenment , people on the old incel subs would say "" feed him a blackpill before he ropes ! "" or things similar . but i ' ve seen a lot of posts of self-loathing and suicidal tendencies that tell me otherwise . what i want to know is why ? why do you all have to hate yourselves for something you had no control over ? you didn ' t ask to be born , you didn ' t ask to exist in this shitty looksist world . it makes no sense to me to beat yourselves up over being alone , especially if your blackpilled and acknowledge there is little you can do in the way of genetics . i was like you at one point in time; i hated myself and wanted to die for not being able to attract girls . however , that was when i was bluepilled/ redpilled , when i thought i actually had a chance . i truly thought the reason i wasn ' t attracting girls was because it was all my fault , that wasn ' t being assertive , charming , charismatic or acting confident enough , not being enough of a haughty douche . every time i developed a crush on a girl , i truly thought it was something i had control over , and that if i got rejected and saw her with some 6 ' 5 "" muscled-out gorilla- looking-man days later , it was because i had fucked up my presentation , that i had my chance with her but i blew it . then one day , after the truth had chiseled away at me long enough to finally break me , i had finally became fully blackpilled . i won ' t go into detail how it happened; it took forever , a death-by-a-thousand-cuts scenario , best saved for another post . when i took the blackpill though , it was like a tremendous weight had finally been lifted . not only did i stop hating myself , but i was able to move on and focus on other things that actually made me happy and love myself . i no longer cared what girls or really anyone thought of me; you ' ll never impress everyone anyway , so why get shook-up over it ? for example , i was at the local archery range the other day , bettering my aim , when an attractive young lady walked in and took a spot near me . now i ' ll admit , my natural instincts caused me to let my guard down and let her in my head . i instantly put pressure on myself to shoot really good and not mess up to impress her , which in turn of course stressed me out bad . but then i quickly came to my senses and told to myself , "" even if i was the human version of legolas , there ' s no way i could flatter her . that would only be if i was a 6 ' 5 "" muscled-out nordic chad . hell , i could be complete shit at archery then , and she would be chomping at the bit to come over and assist me , so she could touch and adjust my arms and feel my muscles and shit . "" and just like that , i calmed down , my mental state was restored , and i was able to go back to enjoying myself and focusing on shooting . now i know some of you are going to say "" i wish i could have a girl adore me like that . "" or "" i ' ll never experience being touched romantically and sensually . "" well , so what ? why should you care if other people don ' t like you ? if you haven ' t already , you ' ll come to learn that 90% of the people you meet are just a bunch of miserable dick-assed weirdos who only enjoy putting others down to make themselves feel better about their own shitty ass lives . they are not worth pleasing . also , a lot of people won ' t get to experience a lot of things . blind people will never get to see their own face . deaf people will never get to hear their own voice . a few years ago , there was this four-year-old kid in my town who had to have all of his limbs amputated , or else this horrible genetic medical condition would kill him . now he will never get to experience walking , running , jumping or playing , or opening his own birthday presents or taking care of himself or anything really for the rest of his life . my point is , yes life is terrible , yes life is filled with suffering , but that doesn ' t mean you have to be miserable every second of every day . as a human being , you are capable of many more amazing things than you realize . as a 25 y/o virgin , i have found so many amazing things to do that made me realize just how amazing i am as a person , and they don ' t involve having a romantic partner; some of these activities are even more enjoyable when you ' re alone . now i ' m sure a lot of you are going to say that i ' m just copemaxxing or something . maybe you ' re right , maybe it is cope , but then again , maybe it ' s not . after all , some of these things , to me , like going on outdoor adventures , hunting , fishing , and hiking the at , pct , and cdt , feel bigger than just settling down with a wife and kids and becoming fully domesticated and tethered down like so many other people do . plus , being single has it ' s advantages , like having a 0% chance of ruining your life by having a kid on accident . the bottom line is , you only live once , you might as well try and enjoy life while you still have it . if the ladies don ' t like you , then don ' t sweat it . it is right , no one is entitled to anything , especially if it involves another person . after all , no one here would like being forced to do something against their will . if girls don ' t pay you any mind , then fuck it ! who needs them ? you can ' t please everyone , so don ' t even try . please don ' t live to try and please other people , does your one-and-only life belong to those assholes , or you ? live for yourself and no one else . when the world turns its back on you , you turn your back on it ! normies will say that this is not a healthy mindset , but normies have proven themselves to be full of shit with their so-called "" advice . "" hating yourself and wanting to commit violence against yourself for something you had no say in is not a healthy mindset either . when someone takes the blackpill it shouldn ' t mean the end of their life , it should mark the beginning of a new one , filled with self-love and acceptance ! tl;dr : taking the blackpill should not make you sad , it should be and indication that you are free to live for yourself . it should disarm all of your self-loathing and tell you that most people are horrible and that their opinions are worthless . do not just ldar . save the ldaring for when you ' re dead , after you ' ve enjoyed your life to the fullest .",0,train

fhx0j4v,"i ' ve got similar issues . i grew up with no siblings and parents who showed zero pda , even in the home . >i cant really tell when she wants to me go for it and start making physical moves . i ' ve learned that they ' re never going to give signs that they want physical moves . they will only give signs they *don ' t want* physical moves . if you are close to her and she leans back , she ' s not ready yet . if she doesn ' t , you can move to the next step . if she has some kind of accessories on her wrists or fingers , lightly touch her hand/wrist and ask about them . she ' ll probably be okay with that , so move to the next step . lightly brush her hair and compliment her on it . if she doesn ' t move her head back , you can continue moving up . if she does give a *no* signal , go back one or two steps , then work your way from there again . that ' s basically how it goes . now what helps me easing into getting more touchy is creating excuses . if she ' s wearing heels , take her down a route with some stairs , and lock your arm into hers for "" support "" . go roller skating and take her hand . teach her how to shoot pool or throw darts--anything that involves touching and moving parts of her body , under the guise that it ' s not *only* sexual touching . kinda like innuendo in speech . one thing i ' m keen to try , is at the first meet going for a handshake and instead bring her hand up to kiss it . i live in japan , and 98% of the female population here goes apeshit over disney prince/princess crap , so i ' m curious how it would play out . from there i could probably go straight to holding hands .",0,train

fixsqin,yeah i mean trying and such as i said in my other response is good practice and definitely confident booster . however being pushy just spoils that . it wastes further time for you and you can creep others . so not good . well i haven ' t been there but if she has rejected him 2 times it doesn ' t sound like she been comfortable . if she has boyfriend you as stranger pretty much have what to talk her about ? she isn ' t interested romantically which she mentioned . so then you turn and say as friend 1 ) that looks needy . 2 ) no one ever would believe that after that point even if you changed your mind . she would always question your intentions hence she plain rejected that option too . then finally somehow she gave ig which is low risk . she can block him if she wants to . plus girls care a lot about instagram followers these days ( lame but true ) . anyway op try what you trying ( cold approach ) but be sensible on people ' s boundaries please .,0,train

fjmm5q,"how to amog beta malesit shouldn ' t surprise anyone here that the red pill is packed with beta males . in fact , it ' s absolutely crawling with them . the problem with any forum on masculinity is that it inevitably gets filled with unmasculine men who have their own theories on masculinity . unavoidably the forum starts catering down to what the beta males already do and therefore want to hear . in other words , reductive power point style lists , conduct manuals , and explanations on why their current behavior is okay . what they desperately want to believe is that the behavior that they are forced to exhibit in their heavily taxed 9-5 corpo cuck job will magically get them laid , even though its not and is actually pulling them down into a soul draining spiral of depression . sexual selection is a means by which females chose exciting new phenotypes for the next generation . females want the fastest antelope , the loudest songbird and the most obnoxious douchebag . they want the male who has what others don ' t and can thus disrupt the status quo . beta males are the status quo which is why their whole strategy is imitation . if you are using pickup lines you are by definition a beta male as you are sexually reliant on imitating the mating strategies of other males . you have admitted to yourself that you are uninteresting , incapable of becoming interesting and need to fool women into believing you are something that you are not . alpha males win the race . beta males buy trophies so they can trick people and themselves into thinking they won the race . if you are interested in seeing this latter behavior first hand , head over to the seduction subreddit . but i must warn you they are complete and utter fags . next we should answer the question : when and why is it necessary to amog aka establish social dominance ? first and foremost , we need a clear definition of what a beta male is . a beta male is a mushy turd that takes the shape of his immediate surroundings . beta males prefer comfort over abstract freedom . they enjoy the warmth and security of the herd and spent their youth being molded into the perfect worker drone consumer by media and education system . they ' re comfortable with how things are and dislike change . therefore if you are pushing for change or advocating for something that is different from the norm you must first break the will of the beta males so they stop clucking and shut the fuck up . obviously the big picture of what you ' re trying to accomplish will remain a complete mystery to beta males because they are pragmatards who don ' t think top down or think in terms of potentiality . in other words , whenever you try to accomplish anything big you will be called an asshole , crazy or dismissed with an all-inclusive meaningless label . that ' s okay . no one accomplished anything meaningful without being hated on in the process , just ask steve jobs . extraordinary men must give themselves permission to perform extraordinary acts so they can rise above the ordinary . **write an article on amoging beta males : ** the easiest way to amog the most beta males is to write an article about amoging beta males . it ' s pretty simple and has an interesting element of recursion . the key takeaway is understanding why this works . beta males are insecure about an endless assortment of trivialities . these insecurities are then weaponized against beta males to make them compensate with overpriced gq commodities , man up and get married and work a bullshit job until they die . beta male insecurities are like mkultra control words , they shut down thinking and induce compliance . my advice is to figure out what beta males are insecure about and mention it as casually as possible . then when the beta male predictably spergs out , use their sperg out as an excuse to exclude them from the decision making process . in other words , exactly how i ' m going to use this post to ban a bunch of sensitive losers . **do you even lift bro : ** the easiest way to increase your smv , become more confident and have a higher tolerance for stress is to put in serious work at the gym . it ' s never been easier to find a gym nearby because there ' s more of them than ever before . gyms are far better equipped than even 10 years ago . finally , bodybuilding is no longer a secretive cult like it was in the 1960s-1990s . all the information you ' ll ever need is available on youtube or amazon bookstore . at this point there is literally no excuse beyond being lazy or retarded . beta males know looking like shit is their fault and their fault alone . broaching the topic directly or just looking fit , is enough to remind them of this fact and send them into an amoged spiral . every article on lifting has hordes of betas crying how jumping jacks in their mom ' s basement is a legitimate form of exercise . blue checkmark twitter is upset that bronze age mindset and fans post physique . lifting is the universal amog . when men feel insecure , their girlfriends notice and look to the source of the insecurity for an opportunity to branch swing . in my experience it ' s not muscularity itself that gets you laid it ' s the high stress tolerance gained from becoming muscular and women noticing how other men behave towards you . **asstimidation : ** while the previous sections explain general amoging principals , this section puts it all together in a practical way for a common place situation . anyone who ' s spinning plates in 2020 knows that these tardettes are constantly on social media farming their orbiters for validation . what if i told you that there was an easy way to make the orbiters work in for you ?

"" wait 20 minutes and send a second pic revealing whose ass it is captioned "" y ' all niggas gay "" . within an hour her phone should be blowing up with angry asstimidated beta males explaining how a mean alpha hurt their *feeeelings* by amoging them . beta males are two things : thirsty for sexy pics and on the brink of abandoning heterosexuality . if questioned tell her that you were feeling sexy and that you didn ' t know that all her guy friends are gay . a lot of men mistakenly believe that being alpha is using cool tricks to feel confident . alpha males don ' t act confident; they are confident because they defeated beta males in competition . things work in the human world exactly how they work in the animal world . competition can be physical , musical , financial , intellectual or psychological . beta males hate competition and hide behind contrived morals to justify their uncompetitiveness . masculinity is competition . the most masculine animals are the most competitive ones . there is no climbing the dominance hierarchy without competing against other men and amoging them in some way . if your goal is to get to the top , you can ' t just sit around defensively passing shit testsyou have to actively compete against other men . since everything is currently going into lockdown now is the perfect time to focus on self improvement . i ' ve mentored thousands of men through fitness and philosophy coaching , here are a few of their [experiences in their own words . ] ( <url> ) you can contact me through that link or shoot me a pm if interested .",1,train

never if you don ' t have to . if you want to proactively amog some other dude it ' s only b/c he has higher social value than you and you want to take him down or the dude is threat to you ( meaning he ' s there to steal your girls ) . there is absolutely no need to amog if you ' re the alpha of the set , if you ' re the most attractive or the most desired . amoging for the sake of amoging ( getting verbally or physically aggressive toward everyone all the time ) is not attractive b/c it demonstrates lack of social intelligence and communicates you ' re an antisocial sperg . amogisn should be a tool not your personality . >6 ) no one accomplished anything meaningful without being hated on in the process , just ask steve jobs . steve jobs was the boss of the people who called him an asshole . iow he paid them to do what he told them to do , however he told them is irrelevant b/c he ' s the boss and he ' s paying . the situation is different if you ' re not the boss , for example you are looking to get some capital from a venture or angel . try being an asshole to vc and see how it works out . if you have the power you can behave like an asshole and be famous for it , be forgiven for it sometimes even liked for it . if you don ' t have the power , you ' re just an asshole . > 7 ) a lot of men mistakenly believe that being alpha is using cool tricks to feel confident . nobody on trp belives in that . this was true in 2005-ish pua days and got corrected on trp a long time ago . >8 ) alpha males don ' t act confident; they are confident because they defeated beta males in competition . this is not true . an alpha becomes an alpha when he "" defeats "" his competition . by definition her orbiters ( men she ' s won ' t fuck ) are not your competition , the other men she ' s fucking are . since she already knows they are beta , you ' re not competing with them you ' re mentally masturbating about how cool you are and how the orbiters are not . this is pointless behaviour reminiscent of incels hating on guys who fuck . if you want to meat your real competition do this ( joke/no joke ) : next time a plate sends you "" i wanna fuck "" text , respond with "" dont have time "" . then stalk her and see who she ' s fucking besides you . 9/10 is some scrub badboy/bordeline junkie who is just chill as fuck and has good vibe women enjoy . and that ' s b/c while working on your looks is important part of the sexual strategy , it ' s not the only one that matters . for more in depth explanation read rollo ' s the rational male .",1,test

"" they demand tibet and east turkistan as *lebensraum* for instance . chinese socialism has always been , from the very start , a nationalist project ( even to this day , the ccp regards sun yat-sen as its forefather despite sun yat-sen being the founder of the rival kuomindang ) . of course the ccp lob the "" racist "" accusation at the west . their entire state ideology is built on an experience of unfair treatment at the hands of western colonial powers ( and with some exceptions , such as hong kong , the simple reality is that the western colonial powers did treat china appallingly ) . the reality , however , is that the west eventually realized that racism , colonialism and the like were bad things . the chinese government , on the other hand , has no such moral scruples . imperial china , and even present-day china , engage/d in absurd levels of racism and colonialism ( they subjugated their asian neighbours frequently , with no remorse whatsoever ) . i mean the blunt reality is that slavery , oppression , imperialism , colonialism and such was the *reality of human history up until the last few centuries* . almost every civilization engaged in these things to some degree , and almost every civilization was the victim of these things to some degree . the west *absolutely* engaged in them . . . just like everyone else . the west ' s record is distinguished only by two things : first , the formalization of the scientific method and the resultant industrial revolution made the west more capable at engaging in these things . secondly , the ideas of the enlightenment ultimately made westerners come to the conclusion that slavery , racism , imperialism and colonialism were all bad things . the west didn ' t invent slavery , but the west was the first civilization to abolish it . yet the west is asked , unlike every other civilization , to contemplate and repent for its own sins . despite the fact that we were the first people to realize they were sins , and the first people to develop a philosophy which consistently opposed all of these things . when the chinese government calls you a racist , tell them to look in the mirror . there ' s a reason the christchurch gunman said the prc was the state most aligned with his values . . . the prc is a fascist , ethnonationalist , racist , colonialist shithole , and beijing is guilty of every sin it accuses the west of committing .",0,test

g62zqj,"what women want> "" after 30 years of studying female psychology , i still haven ' t found an answer to the big question : what exactly do they want ? "" - sigmund freud & # x200b; the more a woman corresponds to today ' s beauty criteria , the more she will turn to the man i will present in this writing . the requirements obviously vary according to their possibilities ( physical , age , intellect ) , their education , background , personal experience . & # x200b; # what women want : biology we start with 10 studies ( [1] ( <url> ) , [2] ( <url> ) , [3] ( <url> ) , [4] ( <url> ) , [5] ( <url> ) , [6] ( <url> ) , [7] ( <url> ) , [8] ( <url> ) , [9] ( <url> ) , [10] ( <url> ) \-pdfs- ) that show us that a woman has two types of male preferences , depending on the period of her menstrual cycle . the terms "" alpha male "" ( defined as sexually attractive ) and "" beta male "" ( defined as sexually unattractive but a good long-term partner ) will be used to summarize these studies . & # x200b; **deep desire** during her ovulation period ( a period of about 6 days when a woman is fertile , normally 14 days after the end of her period ) , a woman will : & # x200b; \- be much more attracted to very masculine men ( with good genes ) : square jaw , deep voice , body odor ( pheromones ) , muscles . . . the alpha male \- be more likely to cheat on her spouse if she perceives him as a beta male and if she has the opportunity to do so with an alpha male \- on the other hand , not wanting to go anywhere else to see if she ' s in a relationship with an alpha male . . . \- be much more critical of her man ( if beta ) by describing him as jealous , possessive and by reproaching him for redoubling his efforts and kindness to keep her ( hence the importance of never appearing to be taken for granted in her eyes ) . the women who declare to be in couple with an alpha report on average that he makes less effort and is less attentive than the beta males , but do not complain about it . \- feel more attractive than the rest of the time and therefore perceive themselves as having more value than their spouse , if they consider him beta ( which may lead to deception to satisfy their hypersexual desire ) \- have a greater desire to go out where she is likely to meet men and tend to dress sexier and more provocatively than usual \- still declare that they are consistently happy in their relationship despite a clear change in sexual preference during their menstrual cycle & # x200b; abstract summary : if you plan to go for a little ride in amsterdam with your mates , avoid doing it during your girlfriend ' s ovulation period . & # x200b; **the ideal partner** women are therefore constantly confronted with the dilemma of choosing a man , alpha or beta , to try to best meet their desires . the best ( most sought-after ) partner is of course the rare combination of the two , the handsome , exciting male who is exciting and stable enough to look forward to long-term prospects . they will logically choose , as long as they can , the alpha male and try to retain him ( "" he ' s afraid to commit ! "" ) . some will still try to get with a "" nice "" guy , i . e . sexually unattractive ( because physically not at the level and with a weak character ) , hoping that he will become virile , an option that has even less chance of success than the first one . & # x200b; men also face this same dichotomy , this time described as the "" madonna and whore complex "" . we are looking for a beautiful , faithful and stable woman . problem , the "" good "" girls are ugly and therefore not exciting , and the hot ones are unstable . the perfect woman is therefore also the rare combination of mother and whore . & # x200b; **the ideal couple** the ideals of both sexes often end up together ( stable handsome guy and stable beautiful girl ) , leaving only incomplete individuals available on the market , trying to find the perfect person , without realizing that they themselves are not perfect in the eyes of the opposite sex ( the stable guy who thinks he is perfect but will never understand that he is not exciting , or the beautiful girl who is unpresentable because of her emotional instability and unbearable sluttiness ) . & # x200b; extrapolating strongly , the winning couple is the alpha male / beautiful virgin girl marriage and the loser couple is the single mother / near virgin beta male marriage . the worst strategy is to marry a slut ( divorcing costs an arm ) while the female equivalent ( having a kid with an unstable alpha who will leave during pregnancy ) obviously has no consequences for the woman . it ' s even a very viable strategy used by some ( getting the right genes and then finding a good father ) . & # x200b; # what women want : physical physical appearance is the eliminatory criterion for both men and women . the myth of women being less visual than men is perpetuated by society , suggesting that personality is the predominant criterion since others are morally unacceptable ( because attracted by the physical=superficial , and attracted by money=profitable ) . & # x200b; **a beautiful boy** women ' s tastes are generally less eclectic than those of men ( who may like tall , short , thin , "" girls with shapes "" , blondes , brunettes , etc . ) . the archetype of the favourite guy is the classic tall , handsome dark brown . non-exhaustive list : 1m80+ , piercing eyes , tanned , impeccable hairline , slight beard , thin with a bit of muscle , broad shoulders , protruding jaw , cheekbones a bit visible , broad smile . & # x200b; feminist propaganda wants us to believe that female beauty standards are delusional when in reality they are the most demanding women in terms of physique . like any person who is devoid of logic and can only see life in a binary way ( "" you ' re feminist or misogynist ! "" ) , they often find it hard to be neutral : a man is either beautiful or ugly . the dating site okcupid shows that 80% of men are physically rated below average , i . e . ugly , by women . conversely , the distribution of scores for women ( rated by men ) is logically close to the gauss curve ( bell curve : majority of women in the average , and as many ugly as beautiful ) . another interesting but obvious fact : the better-looking you are , the more answers you get and the more requests you receive . & # x200b; **friendzone is an ugly thing** by definition , friendzone is the situation where a girl considers us a friend when we are interested in more . there are only two possible cases : & # x200b; \- the majority of cases of friendzone : you ' re super nice but not good enough physically . so you are a friend . it ' s exactly as if we find a girl interesting , intelligent , funny . . . but ugly . no matter what she does , we will never have desire for her , because desire is not negotiable . she ' s still a good friend , but that ' s all . \- second rare but possible case : you ' re a pussy . it happens that a girl finds you physically attractive , but your submissive behaviour is so unbearable to her that she can ' t consider anything with you . you may have sex with her once or twice , but it is impossible for her to project herself into the future with such a baltringue . & # x200b; **the bastard is above all a good-looking guy . . . ** except for a few social cases ( generally having grown up without a father , physically or spiritually absent ) , women are not particularly attracted to assholes who lie , cheat , are violent or impulsive . they simply like male men , i . e . the right balance between the nice submissive who gets trampled on without flinching and the scumbag who attacks others for free . the guy who doesn ' t say yes to everything , who knows how to say no when he has to , and not just to piss people off . & # x200b; the thing is , the good-looking guy can afford to be a bastard because women are , no matter what , physically attracted to him and hope he ' ll go easy on them . the better-looking you are , the more you can afford to behave badly . the uglier you are , the less you will be tolerated . to be desired by being ugly and morally a shit , you need the combination of an incredible vice ( violence , threats , manipulation , extreme domination ) and a psychologically destroyed woman who can attach herself to this type of man . the whore in love with her pimp , so to speak . & # x200b; # what women want : behaviour the behaviour that appeals to women is not witchy and can be summed up in one sentence : live for yourself and stop being a coward . & # x200b; **initiative and sociability** women like to go out , to show off , to see people , while many men can be content to stay at home quietly . they are attracted by extroverts and like guys who offer and take initiative . in short , "" we ' re moving tonight , i suggest you go here "" is infinitely less of a pain in the ass than the tiresome "" what are we going to do , darling ? . don ' t hesitate to impose yourself . if you feel like doing something , invite directly instead of proposing . & # x200b; the men who struggle with this part are often people who don ' t get out much and have to force themselves to look "" normal "" . they don ' t actually have the spontaneity to propose interesting outings since they don ' t usually do them themselves . on the contrary , a guy who has a rich social life , in addition to increasing his chances of meeting people , will simply ask a girl to go to one of his activities . he will be in his element , comfortable , natural . he will not have changed his life for her , but will have invited her to integrate his already existing universe . & # x200b; **masculinity** [a study] ( <url> ) shows that women , regardless of their experience and age , are attracted to narcissists ( who looks alike comes together ? ) . the self-centred man lives for himself , is often active and generally has ambition ( at least to do what he likes , which is already quite good ) . the woman adores this type of man and hopes that he will include her , and only her , in his life project . the worst faggot is the guy who stops his hobbies/passions/dating as soon as he is in a relationship . fortunately , he will often be punished by his girlfriend , who will dump him after a few months of relationship . & # x200b; express your opinions and defend your positions . stop trying to appear perfect in the eyes of women ( and people in general ) , because perfect means boring , drunk and submissive . it doesn ' t mean you have to provoke clashes out of nowhere ( we leave that up to women ) , but if something annoys you , if you disagree with it , say so , express it . stop freaking out at the thought that she ' s going to leave you or lose interest in you . if she leaves , too bad , there will be others . but that ' s unlikely to happen if you stay fair . that ' s the paradox that the "" good guys "" will never understand : when you set your limits , she gets wet , because she sees that you have character and balls . & # x200b; **you should know** one comment that comes up over and over again with men is , "" but why doesn ' t she say she wants a man like that ? it would be easier ! . if masculinity needs to be explained to a man , it ' s because he ' s the wrong man . explaining to a man how to behave kills desire and attraction . how can a woman ask a man to be dominant in bed ? it ' s abbreviated . if he does it , it won ' t be natural , and he ' ll end up doing what she wanted anyway . if he doesn ' t , she will be frustrated because her desire will not be fulfilled . a woman can therefore never express a desire for domination . & # x200b; women keep saying that they want a "" natural "" guy , which means naturally masculine . no one wants to be with someone who simulates behaviour . imagine not being able to get your girlfriend to come and she says , "" don ' t worry , i ' ll fake it next time . it ' s worse ! [women like men who take risks] ( <url> ) . a girl can say no if she doesn ' t like something , but she will never be able to fully express a desire or risk ruining the magic of spontaneity . so you have to guess her expectations , and for that , nothing better than testing ( and it ' s fun too ) . & # x200b; **stop asking questions and take action** since a woman can never fully confess her desire under pain of killing him , the worst thing you can do is to cook her to make her confess what she wants . probably the dumbest thing you can do is ask permission to kiss . even if she wants to , she ' ll say no . you have to try it in a convenient , fairly isolated moment , at a time when there is sexual tension ( don ' t be like the pseudo-street dickheads on the internet who try to kiss a girl after 10 minutes , it ' s ridiculous ) . & # x200b; if a girl gives you her number through her friends , don ' t send her a message asking why . stop being silly , she ' s obviously interested in you . it ' s already a big effort for a girl to initiate contact , so take over the flirting if you ' re interested . same thing if a girl accepts an invitation to your house one-on-one , it ' s not to play scrabble . you think she ' s gonna show up at a guy she doesn ' t like ? if she comes to you and you don ' t try anything , it ' s a rejection in her mind because you didn ' t get her message . in her mind , you ' re either a loser or you ' re not interested . & # x200b; **be handsome , be male . **",1,test

foawwyc,the problem is that we also influence each other . how would women be different if women stayed the same but the paired sex was smaller and weaker . suddenly that smaller and weaker sex might value completely different traits and women might develop differently . lots of our understanding of sex differences has to do with comparison to the other . you cant just remove it and consider one sex in a vaccuum because that is not how a dimorphic species like humanity develops . men and women have different thoughts and traits purely by coexisting with the other .,0,train

g5hbt0,"what is your opinion on john stoltenberg ' s view that masculinity and femininity are artificially created concepts that should be abandoned entirely ? he also believes that masculinity as a concept is inherently toxic ( i ' ll get into the details below , he did an interview where he explains why ) in case you didn ' t know , he describes himself as a radical feminist . he did an interview with vice . com where he goes into more detail on his views on this topic , but i think i can summarize them pretty well in this post . [here ' s his full interview with vice if you to know his view on this issue in greater detail] ( <url> ) . i recommend reading it . basically his argument is that traits and qualities associated with masculinity or femininity are just human qualities that any individual might have , man or woman . men can be shy , quiet , emphatic , etc . and women can be violent , aggressive , prideful , etc . john think ' s it ' s unfair that some of these qualities are associated heavily with one gender or the other , and that qualities such as empathy and kindness are universal human qualities that should not be genderized or viewed as feminine . likewise , women can be violent too , and as such violence should not be viewed as solely masculine . all these traits should just be viewed as human traits . i pretty much agree with this point of view . however , he argues that the main thing that distinguishes masculinity and femininity ( as social concepts/ideas/roles ) is that masculinity promotes violence and aggression , while femininity does not . as such , he argues that masculinity as a social concept is inherently toxic , because masculinity promotes harmful behaviors that femininity doesn ' t promote . even though he believes that toxic behaviors like violence and aggression are not inherent qualities of men or women , he believes that that traits and behaviors promoted by masculinity are generally more toxic than those promoted by femininity . still , he thinks masculinity and femininity as concepts should be done away with . thoughts ? i recommend reading the interview with vice .",0,train

fokjplc,"> communism is bad : starving people , so the millions starving due to poverty due to the existence of capitalism and socioeconomic class everywhere in the world is okay , but communism causes starving is bad ? look you are romanian , surely you know what happened to post-soviet states after the ussr fell - how crime , poverty and hunger exploded over night ? capitalism causes far more deaths than it helps . also , the only reason europe has a good lifestyle under capitalism is it exploits poorer countries for their resources . also , under both soviet and chinese communism , their goal was to eliminate starvation and give everyone access to food >killing people , right and capitalism doesn ' t start wars over oil or resources for the benefit of a few ? i ' m sure syria and libya would beg to disagree >propaganda , censorship , i have shown you in op how capitalist/democratic systems engage in propaganda/censorship . if you really think that there is no propaganda in the west , you ' re delusional >cult of personality , how is raising someone as an example for people to follow bad ? this is literally what happened throughout all of human history through figures like odysseus/or skaldic bards . >eliminating classes , so giving everyone equal opportunity to succeed is somehow bad ? isn ' t this precisely what europe is doing now anyway ? >creating a rich elite that is devoted to the party only capitalism creates a rich elite devoted to money only , that allows them to justify traitorous immigration laws , avoidance of tax , unbeneficial laws , etc . >no opposition , all of the opposition in western countries is controlled , because any opposition that threatens the status quo is either shut down through concepts like ' hate speech ' or the powers that be do everything to discredit it . how is that any different from what the communists do ? >collectivisation and why exactly is collectivization bad ? collectivization protects the individual from harmful influences , gives him a goal to live towards and protects him from the consumerist nihilism present in the modern world . in fact , collectivization would solve many western problems from the opioid epidemic , to obesity , to feminism to male suicide . collectivization is holding people to a standard necessary for survival/prosperity . if you oppose it , you oppose standards , which means you want to stay mediocre making you essentially bluepill >godlike strict rules ( you can not pass a red light as pedestrian otherwise -good citizen score , wtf ?

fosh3p4,"ooook , so , let ' s begin . 1 . there is a difference betweet starving because of commies and capitalism . in capitalism , you have a real canche to get out of poverty , in commie , no . 2 . commies also start wars so , no strong point there . taiwan ? tibet ? butan ? hong kong ? 3 . your "" propaganda "" is not real . china is solely at fault for corona . look at their culture . they eat dogs , cats , bats , koalas , snakes , etc and thet try to eat it as raw as possible because it is considered healthy . well , that backfired , did it not with covid ? in this case : eating bats is not a good thing . some cultures are better than others . still on propaganda : i can watch , listen and read pretty much everything in democracy , can even real mein kampf if i want , you can buy it but not in china . media must he aproved by the gov first , not cool . the "" propaganda "" that you showed , it is in fact , reality . sad to break your commie chinese love but reallity is reallity , just like trp regarding woman . get over the anger phase . 4 . no , cult of personality is not raising someone as an example . stop toying woth words , you start to sound like an shw/antifa . cult of perso is when you are forcebly shoved in your throat a person . for example : stalin , hitler , muso , che , fidel , the kims of korea , hirohito in ww2 , mao , etc . 5 . no , it is not bad , that ' s why we have universal free healthcare ( at least in eu ) , free schools and colleges , police , firemans , housing program , car program . people are not born and will not be able to be all equals , have same chances , this is by default . you might be good at math but i really suck at it , for real . you might be bad at programming but i am a sharp tool in programming plcs in step7 , tia portal and also designing electrical systems in eplan . you and me are by default not equal . equality in chanses , not really , again . even with free healthcare , education and all , there can not be equallity . stop this commie thinking please . also , people do not like to be equals and the same . not everyone wants a vw passat , others want seat leon for example or fiat . also , you want to be equal with elon but elon does bot want to be equal with you . 6 capitalism creates them naturally and by that i mean rich people just became rich because reasons . commies just creates artificial rich people . so you are a starter banker ? if you are not in my close group of friends and not commie , nope , bye . the state wants you out of the elite plus you do not seems , subjectively , dedicated to the commie ideals . sorry man but you are really losing this discussion . commie is bad for culture , humanity , science , etc . whatever . 7 . what other political parties are in china ? is there a liberal party ? conservatorist party ? and i am talking in eu politic terms ( usa is garbage with politics ) . nope , only commies and if you do not vote commies , you are a bad , bad citizen , off to reeducation with you . i am not in the usa sphere of thinking . we have opposition here that fights for it ' s causes . the democrat socialists were in power in romania , they did terrible things and wanted to do more like pardoning people accused of corruption , fraud and money washing but the opposition managed to unite ( liberals , technocrates , idk if i spelled it correctly , other socialist formation ) and together with the people ' s protests , the social democrats felt . this is an example . china ? nope , no opposition , no protests , nothing . 8 yes , i am romanian and collectivisation left a huge wound and scar in our society and for me also . my grand grand father owned a lot of land that was productive , he was working it but when the commies vame to power , he was executed because he did not want to give hi ' s private property to the commies . after 24 years of commie downfall , my family managed to get back only 60% of our rightful lands . no , collectivisation is not ok . it kills private innitiative , it keeps people poor , it keeps people in slavery , etc . stop thinking red . you are in trp and you come with all this crap ? obesity is because people do not care what and how much they eat . suicide rates in males is mostly because they are pussies and not being able to man up . feminism , how it has affairs in collectivisation ? yes , i oppose collectivisation so you can call me a bluepill beta male , i do not care . my wallet says other thing and the keys i have on my keyring also say other thing . ask my lawyer also and he will say another thing regarding the rest of 40% of the missing property that will be gained back . 9 . i will not comment on that , it just sounds so sjw retarded crap with social order . what do you even mean by that ? always explain yourself man when you are having a discussion with someone or an argument . chill , i view this as a discussion and i would like to get more replies from you on this subject . regarding my point made for godlike strict rules : no , i would not like such a system that tells me how to walk , what to wear , how to interract with people , what hairstyle shall i have . the "" new man "" is bad because totalitarian regimes impose their view . in commie romania , the commies envisioned that the new man ( does not matter what sex you are ) must be an engineer , architect , excellent at maths and exceptional scientists . there was no room for philosophers , artists , bankers , priests and other occupations related to those fields . not good , a stable and functioning society needs everyone . from garbage collector , ticket seller , waitress , baker , banker , broker , aetist , philosofer , priest , stripper to engineers , mechanics , scientists , etc . 10 . no , the roman republic =/= chinese republic . do your homework please . usa , france , germany , spain , romania , uk , canada , italy , etc are based on roman republics . china is just a dictatorship , a plain one . 11 . no , there are no drones , spy camers , secret police , radar vans , etc in eu countries . in usa maybe , i do not know but in eu , nope . as i stated in this post previously , policits are totally different from usa and eu . bernie is the only socialist in usa . the rest are conservators that are both in the left and right side which is impossible . only bernie can ve a lefty because socialism and communism in left . but again , i do not know much about usa politics . i view usa as being retarded . while the whole world uses metric system , they adopted their strange and confusing metrics in all aspects of life . wtf is a yard , gallon , mile , inch , fahrenheid ( i am sure i spelled it incorrectly ) , lefties , righties in usa ? 12 well , if china was so rich like you said , why it did not made a huge national program for all people to have electric cars ? heavely reduce air pollution , ban kid labor , not affording more thay 1 kid in family , etc . nope , even tho china is an economic giant , it ' s people are still poor . also , germany ' s economy during a . h . was strong is fake . nope , it was not an economic miracle . hitler knew it and also he said it . that ' s one of many reasons he went to war , for hi ' s country not to economically fail in the next 5-10 years after ' 38 . please , just please , do not throw the "" but brah , da tankz "" because ge was not having that many tanks that others believed and also the tanks were crappy tanks . i would take a sherman , stuart , t34 , su , firefly over any crappy panther , tiger , toger 2 , elephant and also i would take a spitfire and hurricane over any german fighter until the jet ones . 13 . well , communism surely failed . it was present in so many countries during the cold war and then it felt down . south america , africa and other capitalist failed countries do not represent an against capitalism point . it is important to see how they failed also . i can say about romania . it is a struggling capitalist country because 1 . we did not know what capitalism is after 1989 so we are still learning what it is . 2 . our geopolitical position was against it . for cebturies we were invaded and razed by hungary , poland , turkey , russia , austria . can ' t really develop when your villages and small cities are razed , can you ? 3 . after 1989 , people choosed neo commies and guess what neo commies did , they ruined the economy . do you want details ? i will give them if you want . in 2000 , there was another chance . between a nationalist , racist , commie hater , extremist and a commie hooligan , romania choosed the commie . vadim tudor lost the elections because all ex commies allied against him and started a massive propaganda and spread fear ( if he is elected , we all gonna die , executed , at gun point . he will lead us in chaos , dictatorship ) . the commies feared him because they knew that if vadim would be elected , all ex commies would be shot , deported , jailed and monarchy would be reinstalled back in romania under michael the first . can you provide more sources claiming that us soldiers planted the virus in china besides unz ? as a resume : yes , commie is bad , no doubt in that and china created and exported covid 19 by eating crazy stuff , more exctly in this situation : bats . i am not implying or advocating that china should be nuked , attacked with soldiers or anything but instead , china should apologise and take responsability for the situation and also stop being hyprocrites . some cultures are just better than others my friend . edit : you claim to be red pilled but you are against it with commie loving ideas . if you look at trp ideas , values and way of thinking , well , those things would not be allowed in a commie state for both genders .",0,test

g84usv,"society works best when the base assumption is men and women do deserve sex and relationshipsi see it posted around here often that particularly men , but women also , arent entitled to sex and relationships . i dont believe this is true . i think society functions best when the base assumption is everyone is entitled to being loved , having sex and enjoying at least one relationship . i find it alarming that in a culture where we obsess about the health and welfare of the environment and animal kingdom , we care so little about each other and our collective mental health and happiness . the superficiality and cruelty that define the dating market should be beneath the type of people we believe ourselves to be . incels of both genders should have access to legal prostitution and both men and women should be encouraged to be less shallow and more generous in their dealings with each other . so many people now end opportunities for happiness because theyre not getting 100% of everything on their list , mostly women . this dull , checklist-style approach to dating sucks all the fun out of interactions for both genders and leaves many on the sidelines who are good people and would make good partners if others could just get over their superficiality . in short , i think the current state of dating is sad , cruel and shallow , and the idea that only the most shiniest people deserve love is a big reason behind it .",0,test

g6m61c,"lessons from documentary "" liberated : the new sex revolution "" ( non-native here , ignore grammatical mistakes ) & # x200b; hello everyone , i have just watched this documentary which tends to show the reality of this hookup culture particularly focusing on graduates celeberating spring break on florida beaches . some particular examples i would like to quote , "" it is easier to find fwb than boyfriends "" ( girl 1 ) "" guys believe they are entitled to our bodies; there is almost this one guy in every party who try to rip off my clothes "" ( girl 2 ) "" i had always felt pressure from woman magazines to look sexy for boys and engage in frequent sex to get the validation i wanted "" ( girl 3 ) "" i have always felt pressurerized to lose my virginity "" ( guy 1 ) "" sex is not about love anymore , its about pleasure only . i don ' t have to know a girl to get into her pants . let me demonstrate you ( goes to demonstrate it ) . . . you see , its so easy , the more intoxicated she is , the more likely she will drop her panties "" ( guy 2 ) "" i have come with my girlfriend here and i don ' t mind if she hooks up somewhere \[lol a cuck\] "" ( guy 3 ) i live in a conservative muslim country where sexual market is controlled and free sex is frowned upon but thanks to feminism it is quickly changing . i used to believe that i had a disadvantage by not being born into a western liberal country but i don ' t think its true anymore . its not because the girls are magically better but its because feminism has still not been able to destroy the fabric of this society . a regulated sexual market is both good for men and women , women retain their pair bonding ability and men don ' t have to worry about being compared to past sexual partners . its a win-win situation for almost everyone ( almost ) . most people confuse trp with another form of seduction and alpha male to be just a fucking machine . however , the reality is that in a society having the concept of masculinity solely revolving around the number of sexual partners could ( almost ) never produce homely virgin girls ( with few exceptoins ) . the rise of feminsim has seen the rise of pornification of society , single motherhood , divorce rates , false rape accusations and other social ills . women are slowly turning into walking men with vaginas . they love to masculinize themsleves in order to get the dose of power which they could never taste even if they do they shall never be content because a woman ' s satisfaction lies in her being protected by a man . being alpha is not about banging numerous women , this may have been an advantage during the dark ages but we are no longer in the dark ages and sticking to this dogma may damage male pysche as well e . g . depressing over not losing one ' s virginity due to peer pressure instead of working towards worthwhile goals . is dan brazalian more alpha than an anverage guy who is working towards his goal and fortunately have a stable unicorn ? . hence , we should modify who really is alpha male : 1 . always working on self improvment . 2 . protecting his children and women ( unicorn exists in controlled sexual markets ) . 3 . resisting feminism and porn culture . 4 . achieving goals . 5 . ( add what you think is constructive ) . the degeneration of western society and downfall of fatherhood shall continue to move on if something is not done against this hedonistic feminsim . although men have taken advantage from this hook up culture but the price which we are paying is far bigger than what can be put into words . banging multiple women cannot make our lives better , yes there is a burst of pleasure but its not good long term . i don ' t think a hook up culture and controlled sexual markets can co-exist ever . most men here use trp knowledge to get into panites which does work because we know the nature of women but to find a traditional homely women is almost impossible . i utilize trp knowledge to pass shit test of women and her attraction only grows when you pass her shit tests . i was one of the victims of plantation culture until i came to trp and received salvation . let me know what do you say .",1,train

g79bj5,"how mgotw and redpill made me fearful of women and how i got out . howdy ladies and gentlemen . first of all i want to say that i never was an outright member of both movement . i agreed with some concepts and while i never fully drank the koolaid , it profoundly affected me and after 2 long years of being consumed by this ideology , i can finally say that i got it all out of my system . i write this with the hope that it can help others dealing with the same stuff that i ' ve dealt with . # the beginning it all started when i was about 17/18-ish . during this time i used to browse 9gag a bunch and in there i would sometime read about people being screwed over , relationship wise . at the time i just thought "" shit happens "" , but those posts would come again every now and then . my downfall really started on quora and reddit . a big difference between 9gag and these 2 websites was that the posts didn ' t have character limits . quora questions like "" how you found out that your xxx was cheating on you "" and subreddits like r/relationships would lead to posts with lengthy explanations as to how people ( usually men ) would be cheated on in the worst way possible . i remember how i would spend entire afternoons scrolling and scrolling and this made me extremely anxious . my current situation was as follows : overweight , virgin , no friends and my self confidence was at an all time low . just to make you understand how bad it was , i loathed and was fearful of calling delivery services / making appointments and i almost had a heart attack while asking for a summer internship over the phone . # the redpill and mgtow this is when i started to discover the redpill . i watched channels like sandman and other mgtow related stuff and would start to lurk repill and mgtow subreddits . in the beginning it felt as if the pandora box was opened . they said that women would cheat on you regardless of your value as a man and that they would milk you dry if you let them do it , and everywhere i looked , i would just find more stories that would confirm what i ' ve read and heard from this redpill people . even though i was deep in the red pill , i still would have not considered myself to be an outright member of these group . you see , while i believed in hypergamy and the 20% / 80% stuff , i still couldn ' t buy the "" all women are like that "" mentality , both from a logical but also an emotional point . i . e . the overwhelming majority of pedophiles are men , but i never heard women saying anything about all men being child predators ( as far as i ' m concerned ) . i also have a wonderful sister that is in a relationship and looking at them i would see the exact opposite of what the redpillers would say . she would often spend money on him , she took interest in what he did , etc . if my sister was like that then it wouldn ' t have been a far stretch to also believe that other women like my sister existed . to be completely honest i wasn ' t angry at women , i was scared of them . i was scared that i could be cheated on , that if i got married , they would divorce me and take my stuff or that that she could have an affair and i would have raised a child that was not mine . to give you an example of how deep my paranoia went , i often played with the idea of having hidden cameras in my house , trackers in vehicles and taking paternity tests behind a potential partner ' s back just to be sure that i wouldn ' t not meet the same fate as the people who got fucked over . # how i got out well , to be completely honest it was a multitude of things . first thing first , i deleted reddit and quora . this places were tainted to me and even nowadays i get somewhat nervous if i enter these websites . the next step was actually going my on way . instead of listening to bitter and resentful people , i slowly began to block their generalized opinion and actually started to build an opinion of my own . i started to hit the gym ( lost 21 kg / 46 pounds ) , learned to be impartial and to take any opinion with a grain of salt . more importantly , i started to be critical of my own beliefs . if i didn ' t have a sound logic to it , it had to go . now i ' m 20 and i ' m far more calm and retrospective person . i ' m still a shy guy and still never had a girlfriend , but that ' s just what it is . i learned to not being so fearful of random people and more importantly pizza delivery services . on monday i will call a company to see if they will give me a another summer internship and to be honest , i ' m already shitting my pants , but at least now i know that i have to face my fear instead of letting it dominate me . cheers . edit : i called . it went good . nothing official because of the current situation , but i ' m confident i will get the place . cheers .",0,test

"" or "" am i asking too much to expect that my partner ___ "" . the way people respond to those two questions is dramatically different too . people often will echo "" yes , you ' re a bitch "" back , but they will answer "" am i being unreasonable "" with "" no , boundaries are important "" . gender bias plays out in this situation like you wouldn ' t believe . people who are disinclined to support a woman who might be being a "" bitch "" to their partner ( even if the specifics of the situation are the exact same ) will support respectful boundaries , clear communication , and taking responsibility in the next breath . similarly , telling someone to man-up is actually really unclear advice . what does that mean ? what does one *do* if they actually want to man-up ? a large percentage of the time , that evolves into "" sit down and have an honest conversation about your feelings "" which , i think you ' ll agree , is a weird definition of "" man-up "" . what i find is that gendered slurs usually are a short-hand for a complex and largely unconsidered pile of baggage that everyone means and understands in their own way . you can still call someone an asshole , a piece of shit , a cheater , a loathsome creature , an emotional terrorist . you can still say terribly mean things about people without using gendered slurs . you actually don ' t say much when you tell someone to man-up , quit being a pussy , stop being a fuckboy . when you ask 35 people a day to reword that to make it something else , you realize that no one is really communicating with those words at all . they are just thought-terminating cliches for feelings people mostly never consider .",1,test

g7076h,"1 in 4 men experience rape/ violence and/or stalking by an intimate patner - yet there are 2 mens shelters in us compared to 2000+ for women . abuse is an awful crime and we must take a more fair approach when deciding how we offer resources to victims . this is not to downplay any abuse suffered by women . and there are myriad platforms this is discussed in . my personal take is not to gender this issue and to deal with violence in general ( yes we accept there are gender differences , in this case actually a lot so we act differently as appropriate and only where needed but we tackle the issue as a whole from the outset , using gendered laws and terms only when there is a good reason ) . however , this is not a commonly held view . for some dare i say almost all feminists , this is a gendered issue and the 1 in 4 men are not of concern as we should be focusing only on women . **this is not a "" feeling "" or a sentiment that you can deny by simply saying "" i don ' t so its not true , feminists do support men "" ** \- it is a cold hard fact , 2 mens shelters compared to 2000 for women as a result of where they have focused their attention in reality , biased policies and campaigns only focusing on women; multiple specific gendered domestic violence acts and laws yet always and exclsively for women alone . the soloution : either feminists need to take this issue about men seriously in terms of trying to solve it with cold hard actual change/ lobbying/ campagning/ funding/ ( not just "" yeah men can be victims too we care "" ) or they need to allow mra ' s to approach the issue without the constanst blocking/ banning/ no platforming mras who do receive . even the sheer outrage when we mention statistics . ***legendary feminist erin pizzey opened the first battered shelter for women in the world . when she attempted to do so for men , many years later she received death threats and rape threats by other feminists . domestic violence , was raised in the mens conference at the university of cambridge . this event was savagely no platformed/ protested and by ( some ) feminists and they even played bells to stop the speakers from being heard . *** & # x200b; 1 . other points , is time to remove uncessary gendered laws in many countries and states such as "" male assualts female "" which is a specific offence in some us states and commonwealth countries . entirely uncessary , as it is covered under normal gender neutral law , and it makes no sesne why there should not be a "" female assualts male "" law or female assualts child and so on . 2 . in countries such as australia there are no mandatory courses abusers who are women who are domestic abusers on avoidin violence , yet there are for men against women . this is one of countless over sights and gendered centric approaches , that currently taget one gender only . 3 . either gender neutral violence acts ( that of course leave room for even significantly different approaches to the genders , as it is very different ) or specific acts that cover mens abuse , as there will be differences . 4 . the law needs rapidly gender neutralisisng and services refocused so we avoid regular occurences were male victims who call the police are being arrested or leaving the home ! male victms being charged with dv and then forced to pay fines , attend training : [<url>] ( <url> ) . see the videos in ( 5 ) and you can clearly see why this is happening . 5 . general public awareness and understanding , so we avoid this : [<url>] ( <url> ) [<url>] ( <url> ) [<url>] ( <url> ) [<url>] ( <url> ) thoughs and ideas ? \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ \ # debate the ideas , not the person # do not judge people ' s competence or moral goodness/badness based on their junk please . # stop gendering every issue when it is not required # men and women work together tp get shit done # some men , some women , not all men , all women # make love not war # be kind # use a bidet to wipe please # wipe from front to back , never the other way unless you want a uti \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_",0,train
foegmm5,"the feminist steelman answer is . . . why don ' t you men solve this problem for yourselves ? after all , though heavily oppressed , women organized to get this all done , lobbying the government . why can ' t you ? and that ' s a good question . why do men have such a hard time gaining a foothold for charities and non-profits ? why are both conservatives and feminists so agreed that under no circumstances should welfare go to men ? ( i have my guesses but i don ' t know for sure . ) i personally don ' t know if welfare for men is the answer . but we already have a billion dollars a year in vawa funding for organizations that care almost exclusively for women despite literally decades of peer reviewed research showing the full picture of dv . ***a democracy is always temporary in nature; it simply cannot exist as a permanent form of government . a democracy will continue to exist up until the time that voters discover that they can vote themselves generous gifts from the public treasury . from that moment on , the majority always votes for the candidates who promise the most benefits from the public treasury , with the result that every democracy will finally collapse due to loose fiscal policy , which is always followed by a dictatorship . ***",0,train

fofcu14,the answer is male disposablilty and lack of in group bias . feminists never had to convince people that women suffering was inherently bad . just show the bloody women and people get upset . show a bloody man and half the population will make a joke and the other half will be disgusted with his weakness . men have an innate need to protect women . not men . women have an innate need to protect women . not men . so who does that leave that just honestly cares about men ? dogs . and unfortunately they can ' t vote . there ' s a reason so many women become mras or at least not feminists after having sons . they can ' t really sympathize with men as a group or even their husbands . but their own child suffering resonates with them .,0,train
fof18pi,"> it is a cold hard fact , 2 mens shelters compared to 2000 for women check what those numbers represent before comparing them , because last time i saw this discussion it was comparing the the number of *exclusively male* shelters with the number of shelters that *accept* women . your sources listed are all youtube videos - ignore those , and check *their* sources . and if they don ' t give their sources then , well , disregard everything they say . don ' t have time now , but maybe i ' ll give it a look tomorrow . > for some dare i say almost all feminists , this is a gendered issue and the 1 in 4 men are not of concern as we should be focusing only on women . prime strawman there . i can just as validly say that *all* people who care about men ' s or equal rights want women to be subservient maid slaves . equally valid , in that it ' s not at all valid . > either feminists need to take this issue about men seriously in terms of trying to solve it many of them , if not most , do . they ' d tell you this is all largely a facet of toxic masculinity , in which society dictates that men shouldn ' t seek help in the first place ( or else they ' re weak little bitches ) , and to your other points , that if a domestic violence case is called in , they arrest the man regardless of the situation because man r strog . of course , when feminists say this is part of toxic masculinity , the brains on the men ' s rights side tend to turn off and instead focus on attacking feminism as a concept rather than , you know , actually trying to fix the issue . > other points , is time to remove uncessary gendered laws in many countries and states feminists are way ahead of you . support the equal rights amendment .",1,test
fof8de0,"thanky you for your reponse . yes i reject the idea of toxic mascullinity . what you are describing i would attribute to gynocentrism and also male disposability/ the gender empathy gap as the videos show . see the video below for toxic feminitiy - and yes it does lead to death and violence . i dont think toxic femininity should be gendered . funnily enough , the few feminist who have agreed that toxic feminity exists again do not call it this , they blame it on the patriacrhy and at times call it internalised mysogony . if feminism continues to use such deregatory and bigoted terms such as toxic msaculinity , mansplaining , manterupting , etc then karen , toxic feminity etc will inevitably also result , and we dont want either of these , yet currently we have it one way . id rather not see the rise of the term femsplaining and femislplaining ( where feminists explain to men their lived experiences ) toxic femininty : [<url>] ( <url> ) & # x200b; thank you for your support of the issue . as i said though , there is clear violent opposition to it by ( some ) feminsists and also society at large , also , as i gave clear examples of the is it 2 because some take men is irrelvant . it is still vastly different whether 2 vs 2000 or not ( some , but sadly mainstream and the ones that actually matter ) feminists , sadly are not ahead as you state , they have precisely created those gendered laws and issues in the first place : [<url>] ( <url> ) this is why it is very good that western feminists are not tackling issues in india or saudia etc . ( they wont anyway as it wil cause more probems for them , apart from say it is bad , but that is another debate ) anyway : "" there are many ways that sexism harms women in india , there are also many ways that the same sexism benifits women . there are also many ways in which sexism specifically harms men , and in many ways that that same sexism benifits them . to fix the issues in places like india , we need an egilatrian approach , or we dont need a name for it just a global approach that solves issues of both genders and not one way . . . . for example in saudia arabia , it is not fair to allow women the right to work but still keep the rule that womens personal income is solely for her , and that a man is legally obliged to provide for her as well as the social pressure to do so also . also women cannot not keep the rule where their money is solely theirs and not their husbands , and then still expect larger inheritances . that kind of change is what ( most ) feminists would do if they got involved ( western ones wont anyway apart from to talk about it ) , as they would only focus on womens issues such as right to work , yet ignore obligation to be guaranteed finanicially looked after . i am not speculating , similar things happened right from 1st wave feminism ( and \[some\] feminists did this on purpose e . g . took property that they acquired the legal right to but the men still had the responsiblity of the tax for , and some men went to jail for not being able to afford their wifes property , which they would still keep and would not sell ) """,0,test

g5co53,"4 simple activities/habbits to develop during quarantine in order to transform yourself . ive seen people talk about how during these times of uncertainty it is important to love and forgive yourself , to allow yourself to eat snacks and trash foods , to spend * ( waste ) * your time playing video games and binge watching shitty tv shows and netflix series . while i agree that its good to spend some time having fun and enjoying yourself , this is no excuse to let go and consume your free time . instead , i **urge** you to **produce** instead of **consume . ** 1 . **work out** - im hopeful that at least 90% of the active users of this sub have already developed and follow a work-out routine . this goes to the people that are not already working out and especially for those who have been working out and have stopped due to the lockdown . just get yourself up and do it . it doesnt matter what you do , just go for a walk , a job , run , ride your bike , do some push-ups , burpees , bodyweight squats . there is an abundance of exercises you can do anywhere , anytime . your gym being closed is not an excuse to sit on your couch and get fat while you play call of duty or something and eating oreos or other trash foods . work out , your body will thank you , your mind will thank you . working out relieves stress , improves your cardiovascular health , your immune system , as well as your body and mind altogether . if youre struggling to find a routine to follow during quarantine , feel free to shoot me a pm or ill post a free home workout program here . 2 . **start cooking** cooking is fucking amazing . it is one of the most relaxing activities i do on a daily basis . besides the fact that youre being creative and cooking your own meals which helps avoiding trash foods , snacks etc . it is also a perfect time to listen to an audiobook , a podcast or any other educational/self-improvement video/audio . i find myself being extremely focused when i cook and i absorb any information easily . if youre not into audiobooks/podcasts , just put your favorite tunes and vibe it out . but for real , start cooking your own meals , its great and its not as time consuming as you might think it is . 3 . **educate yourself** 3 easy suggestions : 1 ) **read books . ** any book that seems interesting to you , read it . trp is the reason i now read books and it has insane benefits for the human brain . it helps me build focus , expand my vocabulary and gain knowledge on a wide spectrum of things ( psychology , philosophy , business , finance ) . it started with the rational male and turned into friedrich fucking nietzsche and ancient greek philosophy . 2 ) **take online classes . ** there is an abundance of free online classes available . hell , even watch youtube videos about something and take notes . its 2020 , education is available online and for free . i feel like a moron for wasting 6 years getting 2 university degrees . 3 ) **watch documentaries/docuseries instead of tv shows . ** documentaries about anything , serial killers , abuse , gender equality ( if you wanna get triggered ) . anything is better than watching pointless tv shows . 4 . **develop new skill ( s ) ** on the same note as the above , try to improve yourself by developing a new skill . two personal examples im focusing right now are : learning a new language and experimenting with investing/day trading . but this can be anything , a physical skill ( learn how to handstand or smth ) , play an instrument , learn coding , cooking ( see point 2 . ) , fix things , build things , craft etc . your future self will be glad youve taken the time to develop new skills . 5 . **meditate** its important to train the mind as well . take time to dose off , give your head some space . relax and focus on your breathing and how your body feels . remember that you are the essence living inside the body , so take care of the presence . remind yourself of what is within and come to peace with it . it will greatly relieve your stress , anxiety , depression , as well as to improve your sleep and attitude in general . **epilogue : ** this is the perfect time to work on you . improve you . fix you . transcend you . there is no excuse for being lazy , having terrible eating habbits and not taking care of yourself . remember that one day things will go back to normal . you can be the guy who comes out of this completely transformed . healthier , better looking , wiser , craftier and maybe even wealthier . do you want to waste your life because there is a global pandemic ?

g64n9q,"the dual mating strategies of men and womenalpha fucks and beta bucks is a well documented phenomenon in the red pill . its the so called dual mating strategy that describes a womans instinct to seek sexual opportunities from the alpha ( alpha fucks ) and provisioning opportunities from the beta ( beta bucks . ) it seems generally assumed in the sphere that this strategy is exclusive to women , so this will be my brief attempt to show that a dual mating strategy is also present in men . across the sphere we see rp men constantly admitting their dual mating strategies . we want to fuck hoes , and marry virgins ( low n-counts . ) we want a lady in the streets , and a freak in the sheets . men seek sexual opportunities from the whores , and provisioning opportunities from the virgins . sigmund freud expressed this dual mating strategy in his madonna/whore complex : the tendency in men to view any particular woman as either a madonna or a whore . madonnas ( dont think of the superstar by this same name , it will confuse you ) are women we perceive as pure , submissive , obedient , and faithful . whores are women we perceive as sluts , large n-count , tattoo-ridden , disobedient , and unfaithful . history is full of men who were in love with their madonna wives , only to cheat on them with a whore . in fact many rp players have made careers out of fucking hoes only to eventually marry a woman they perceive as a madonna . we all carry this madonna/whore instinct inside of us , and its quite clearly a dual-mating strategy , if we care to admit it . this dual-mating strategy for both men and women may be a result of pre , and post , agricultural revolution societies . the findings of evolutionary psychology suggest that before the agricultural revolution sex in humanity was far more polygamous , liberal and free . people tended to sleep around for various reasons without taboo or stigma . theres a lot in our biology that is evidence of this . this doesnt mean a womans hypergamy wasnt in effect , it just means being a hoe wasnt looked down upon . if this is true its safe to assume that women were hoes for a very long period of time . and this would explain our natural attraction to hoes . further , pre-agricultural revolution , there was no such thing as property , assets , and marriage . post-agricultural revolution introduced property , assets , and marriage , and this changed sexual relationships forever . people began to think heavily about guarantying their property and resources was passed on to their progeny . men became interested in women who could guarantee this bequeathment , and women became interested in men who would share their resources . suddenly virgins and beta men became more attractive . the forces of this new social pressure conditioned women to look for men who could provide provisioning ( betas ) , and those same forces conditioned men to seek women who could be trusted with their resources ( madonnas . ) virgins can be trusted with property and assets more than whores , and beta men can be relied upon to share their resources more than alphas . in this hypothesis , a dual-mating strategy evolved in both men and women out of our ancient past of free and unbridled sex ( pre-agricultural revolution ) and the relatively recent development of commitment sex ( post-agricultural revolution . ) in the rp theres this idea that you must maintain alpha-ness in your relationships at the expense of beta-ness , so that your wife doesnt cuck or leave you . while theres obvious truth to this , we should condition this view against our own dual mating strategy . in the life of a man , a virgin is perceived to be a prize . sure , nothing turns us on more than a whore , and some married men will fuck them given the opportunity , but many wont . many married men will stay faithful to their madonna , even though she doesnt turn them on like a whore . understood in this way , we can see that while women may be attracted to alphas , for them the prize might very well be a beta . this is why we teach comfort tests . and while some women in relationships will still fuck the alphas , many of them wont , and will stay faithful to their beta . af/bb is not a black and white line , its just an evolved tendency in women , just like the madonna/whore complex is an evolved tendency in men . but neither of these tendencies dictate with any certainty how a particular man or woman will act . this is not an excuse for a man to be a little bitch , a real rp man knows how to be both alpha and beta . i admit that the theory of af/bb and madonna/whore instincts evolving out of a pre , and post , agricultural revolution society might simply be conjecture . but , the evidence that men have a dual mating strategy ( like women ) is overwhelmingly evident and universal .",1,train

either physically , or emotionally or mentally , and when he has neither the tools nor the awareness nor the frame to deal with it . if he doesn ' t find the tools , the results can be catastrophic . one only needs to look at what kind of shit men can land up into - violent crime , abusive relationships , suicides , drugs , alcohol -- and every one of this is due to past trauma that never found space and consciousness to heal . to add to the challenge , men often do not have support systems , those whom he needs in his low moments ditch him for the good times and he is ridiculed for trying to seek help . man is ridiculed for even saying he has a problem . even in effective support systems meant to help him , he has to face at least 50 people all calling him a faggot for every mistake and has to earn his respect ( mrp , i ' m looking at you . . . and respect you ) . a man learns soon that there is no substitute for strength and being proactive . let ' s make the exception for lasting physical trauma . soldiers who come back with ptsd and worse from wars have often been found to have suffered lasting brain injuries and lesions , which are responsible for the symptoms . some people with an altered personality have been known to have had a brain tumor in a particular part of their brain . so , physical damage is the one thing a man might totally not recover from . but that hasn ' t stopped them from trying . but when a man does have the tools and cultivates some awareness and frame , the mental and emotional scars can soon be overcome , and except severe injuries that caused permanent damage to the body , many injuries and diseases can also be fixed medically today . everyone who has ever contributed to rp awareness has shared their own tools from their toolbox for this purpose ( for those who ask ) . i too found some really powerful tools for me , which i have shared . once a man has somehow found the space he needs to make even a little peace with his past , his problem solving mind gets to work , learning lessons from the experience , developing a new mindset and approach , looking at what went wrong and how to improve his results . recognizing that there is no support granted to him , but the need must still be addressed nevertheless , a man decides to create what is missing in life himself , walking the hard path . it is a long an arduous road to create what has not existed before . if needed , man seeks out discomfort in planned doses , gains additional experiences , works on himself and gets better and better every time with each additional experience , every failure and success until he masters the challenges that once seemed impossible to him . as every rep he does stimulates more muscle to grow afterward , men simply improve with experience . men use their past to attain mastery in the present . man essentially runs on the paradigm ** "" what doesn ' t kill you makes you stronger "" ** . of course let ' s be practical and add this line - ** "" once he recovers from it . "" ** this is also and especially true for sex . a man who has embraced his sexuality gets better at the game with every experience . a man once awakened , doesn ' t mind systematically annihilating his past dysfunctional self to become a more evolved being . a bad past however has a much worse impact on a woman , given her much greater sensitivity . it creates a self perpetuating trauma pattern in her that keeps her locked in it . if her past was abusive , expect her to have a much greater tendency to pair up with the abusive assholes and suffer all her life , even if it means her children suffer at times . 10 minutes of sex god and she is alpha widowed for life and can ' t enjoy sex that way with other men again . 10 years of riding the cock carousel before settling down with a nice provider means it ' s only a matter of time before she gets bored with marriage and aspires for the thrill of the chase again -- once unstable relationships , always unstable relationships . or if she gets violated against her will , she can feel horrible , ashamed , dirty , even defiled and this can make it impossible for her to let go and enjoy herself with a future lover . there is no end to those complications and all the forms past unresolved emotions can take . **in matters involving any significant intensity of emotion , a woman essentially becomes the victim of her past pleasure and

the emotional level . a woman who has to wear the pants in the house invariably develops contempt for the man who doesn ' t . behind every feminist champion , you can always find a woman emotionally scarred to some degree or the other . tough women especially carry boat loads of unresolved emotional pain . there are many such women who have manned up only to lose faith in men and carry bitterness and contempt towards men for not having the manliness that a woman was capable of summoning . unresolved past sexual trauma can subconsciously force a woman to make herself unattractive and unhealthy , which is what we see in many feminists , as a way to avoid the possibility of a repeat of that experience and getting hurt again . by comparison , men who are hurt try to avoid relationships . the tendency of the feminine ego to seek refuge in the feeling of victim hood does not help in this - it helps keep her past alive in her . a bad past just gives the victim tendency a first class ticket . the fact that women tend to be a herd animal with a significant collective hive mind component to their existence makes it worse . in one room , all that one woman has to do is to bring out her past emotions and you can be sure that within minutes , even seconds , that all the women are feeling the same thing . the impact of past experiences on a woman is simply deeper and bigger already due to their sensitive nature , and it only gets multiplied further by the collective pain body of the feminine . we even see this any time she ' s in a bad mood -- they remember past miseries and mistakes in excruciating detail don ' t they ? not all of a woman ' s pain or emotion is hers alone , it ' s the pain and emotion of womankind . let ' s not even get started on bad habits . women who get into drinking and drug abuse wreck their lives and the lives of their families and children in spectacularly horrible ways . and once it starts it becomes near impossible for them to stop . i see a lot of men in mrp in the oys threads working on their addictions from alcohol to the smartphone and porn , but i don ' t get to see many woman come out of deep shit by themselves . they ' ll need help , if they are capable of being helped at that point that is . while a man can get to enjoy the feeling of mastery at the end of his struggles and suffering and victory , a woman is still left with a bitter taste in her psyche and lots of unresolved pain even if she ends up succeeding . even success doesn ' t seem to fill up a woman ' s emotional holes - you can see this with any successful woman who had to wear the pants to get there . there is some unhappiness in their tone , as though they regret the impact it had on their femininity . as for a history of crazy sexual behaviour , when i see the stories of many of these women , with notch counts that would have been impossible without contraception , their troubling past prior to that , along all the thoughts and emotions that these women admit to having over time swinging across the entire spectrum , and add the impact of powerful sexual memory on their system , all i can say is that it ' s a case of absolutely fucked up , both inside and out . the fuck up outside just reflects the fuck up on the inside , and makes it worse . the biggest mistake is to assume and believe what they say as if the impact of such powerful emotions and experiences can simply be wished away by rationalization . a lifetime spent running full throttle in one direction will never magically fix itself overnight . as i wrote in my post on the irony of "" choice "" , it is stupid to think you are choosing when your mind has this much grip over you . these women may claim they are over it , but deep down their minds are still in the same deep turmoil of thoughts and emotions as ever and they have never addressed that . that software runs freely on the inside , just hidden . that won ' t stay quiet for long . sooner or later their unhappy selves are going to emerge for the next round of seeking salvation elsewhere , or they are going to go crazy . and that ' s why you should never listen to their claims that they ' ve overcome their past . that as you will read below , requires exceptional work , the honesty to face oneself and take responsibility for once , and they should have clearly done it and have results to show for it . you cannot practice instability all your life and then hope to stay stable and committed one fine day . how in the world did men start believing that shit and even white knighting for it by any logic is beyond me . so for all but the most spiritual of women , a woman essentially runs on the paradigm of being a victim of her past -- ** "" what doesn ' t kill her enslaves her "" . recovery ? oh god . . . ** why i said all but the most spiritual women was that there are some women who do find tools to work on themselves , a few do end up recovering from their past experiences , but if you ' ve ever read some of the books written by them on the subject , you can tell that the recovery process is a battle , involving massive emotional releases , moments of very altered moods and the like - it ' s like 4th of july . the key difficulty is that women being more emotional , find the way of awareness and inner peace inherently more difficult , and have a lot of extra pain to resolve . usually devotion , service , nurturing others and emotional methods work much easier with them ( which is why more women than men go seek religion ) . but it is not impossible , and the tools can also work extremely well with them . in fact most of the tools will work on anyone who is serious about using them . trouble is , many of these women are too deep into the grip of their own past patterns to get to the start line even . it takes women years of work to get to a point where a lot of their traumatic patterns are dissolved and we ' re back on a clean slate , though by then , they might not even be physically in their prime . biologically women have a shorter prime than men to bear healthy children and then be healthy enough to raise them to adulthood . men on the other hand , can keep their physical and reproductive prime up for longer . the task of "" annihilating their past unhappy self "" is therefore much harder for a woman and needs more work . a man would find it easier to help himself or recruit help where he doesn ' t find help by default , but women really do need far more hand holding when dealing with deep inner pain . sometimes absolute dominance is probably the only way to force them to start to work on themselves . biologically a woman who has a bad past or a history of bad habits , or even a very stressed history has a much greater chance of hurting the physical and mental health of an unborn child . in old school societies , lots of care is taken to see to it that pregnant women are kept emotionally "" well fed "" . just a history of lots of stresses , irregular hours of food , diet and rest can damage their fertility and reproductive health . no one mentions the impact of abortions and contraception on reproductive health and hormonal balance . a woman ' s body is a significant biological investment , and men are biologically wired to be repelled by women with a history of destructive habits and behavior . do keep in mind though that a man ' s bad habits like smoking and drinking and sedentary living also damage his reproductive health and t levels , but again , good habits , lifting and diet can go a long long way to correcting this . fitness also has equally positive effects on a woman ' s health , but most unhealthy women i tell you also come with a significant degree of mental and emotional illness and are too far in a hell hole to even turn up at the gym . **most women who are unhealthy today are actually so because of an underlying emotional or mental problem , while most men are just plain lazy** . in my world , women will have to lift , do yogic practices and meditate . for their own good . i won ' t accept those not willing . amidst all this , anything a woman gains in technical skill from her sexual experiences can easily become irrelevant . besides , a skilled man can always train a willing woman ( go to mrp and see that latest post ) , leaving her free to concentrate on the seduction part of her game . i honestly feel sadness and pity for many of these women whom i see , broken wrecks of what could have been . i couldn ' t stay cold about it if it happened to any of the women in my family or life , but honestly , they ' re doing it to themselves and save-a-hoe is just stupid -- the foolish nice guy who wants to save them and change them just gets swept into that shit and realizes too late that this is way beyond his power to solve , and he might not even be able to get out safely from crazy . in the case of woman and the impact of her past on her psyche , prevention was always far better than cure . let ' s be real about that . that ' s why old societies were always so strict with their women . so in the end , a man ' s past can end up making him stronger and wiser and he can look back at it honestly without toxic shame , with a degree of pride and gratitude even -- as a very harsh teacher , but the one he needed , that taught him permanent lessons . women on the other hand , are often left with permanent or lasting physical and psychological damage from their pasts far more than lessons learned . men become responsible for themselves over their past , women become victims of their past . **and that ' s why a man ' s past and a woman ' s past are simply not comparable . ** we ' re not denying that men too get damaged from their past , but unless its a serious physical injury , it is indeed easier to recover from that and emerge stronger than it is for a woman . what doesn ' t kill a man makes him stronger once he recovers from it . what doesn ' t kill a woman tortures her for the rest of her life . and that is how it goes for all but the most exceptional cases . *ps : when i used the word "" past "" , it wasn ' t in the context of reputation , but past experiences . now about reputation -- a woman ' s reputation did matter enormously in societies of the past , and i myself know that my grandmother would have preferred death to shame and loss of reputation . but in a feminine primary society , the sisterhood will defend her in public , encourage her in private and bitch about her behind her back . yes , that last part is true . * *a man ' s reputation however is everything , especially in this kind of society . it is more vulnerable than the most delicate and sensitive woman , and as easy to shatter as glass , and easier to damage forever . a woman will cast allegations on you , even and especially false ones if it benefits her , her sisters will vilify you as a monster , your rival men , her orbiters , and envious betas will rush to her aid , glad to see your downfall , the white knights and sjws will attack you , and the justice system exists for the sole purpose of screwing you forever , you ' ll be abused and raped in prison hell , you ' re out of the job market , the feminist dominated media will write any shit on you if it sells , society treats you in ways they didn ' t treat slaves or untouchables , and your best hope is to actually stfu and fight to the end --* ***rape of a man is the rape of his reputation and freedom . *** *once raped , it will never recover to the way it was formerly . * *only god alone can save you if truth is on your side tbh . so remember law # 5 always --* ***so much depends on reputation , guard it with your life ! ***",0,train

fo5rd20,"what i believe to be going on here is you have noticed how the media grabs the attention of people , largely young and immature that dont have developed emotions , portray romantic situations . when we are young and the person we like has a boyfriend or girlfriend , we often think of the other as a bad person so we arent guilty for wanting someone that is committed/involved/seeing to someone else , especially when we arent getting any attention . when media targets this audience , they portray this situation to be true , affirming the viewers feeling of their interests partner as a dick . we love feeling right . while this is largely portrayed as a young man having interest in a girl whos ex or partner is a dick ( scott pilgrim vs the world for example ) , it is portrayed both ways . often , the love interest male is dating a pretty girl that isnt right for him ( im looking at you taylor swift in you belong with me ) . essentially , it is hoping that the audience watches this to affirm their feelings , so they consume the rest of the medium ( movie , album , etc ) . it reflects a me not we mentality when it comes to love . the subject in both gendered roles is only thinking about what they want , disregarding the other person of interests choice in their actual partner . i studied what love actually is using a lot of philosophical backing , and i can say with confidence this is more possession than it is love , which is what we feel in our high school days and thats fine . many young people confuse the two , as long as our life experience enable us to move on and exist with self love and eventual outward love . in short , its a product of immaturity more than sexism , but sexism can definitely spin this situation into something else when it comes to relationships . all that being said , people dont always choose people that are good for them . no one is perfect theres a very interesting psychological theory that analyses the people we find appealing romantically , and how it relates to our past . people are likely to date those that give us familiar types of suffering as opposed to those that show us new types . for example , if your parents always yelled at you and you never got over it , you would date someone that yelled to communicate adversity . same thing with passive aggression , violence , and communication . we choose the familiar , unless we actively take steps to avoid it . and when someone we want to date chooses someone who gives them the suffering they are used to , it justifies the feelings i previously discussed even more . ( heres a really cool video on the suffering bit , its far from hard science but is a really interesting theory on relationship dynamics as it relates to developmental psychology : <url> ) . to summarize , love triangles are common and no one thinks wow my love interest didnt choose me , but thats fine ! until they love themselves . edit : had to change the taylor swift song to the one i was thinking of , and added the part about relationship dynamics",0,train

fofrrq7,"former textiles guy here . generally what this says about wool/cotton/poly is true but many caveats . **poly doesnt absorb**- true the material itself doesnt absorb , but youll notice most sportswear worm when youre sweaty is poly . why ? because you can extrude the thread in high-surface area threads break up surface tension or hollow threads that use capillary action to which away . ( imagine the play dough machine squeezing out a macaroni shape vs a star shape noodle , the star shape will wick better . poly is also quicker to dry because it doesnt hold onto the water due to absorption . poly is also more durable . this is because the fibers are smoother and dont create the self-abrasive friction that wears down yarns as much as other fibers . wool & cotton are both rough under a microscope . **cotton comparison vs wool . ** - there are several types of cotton on the market . the 2 main differences in the material are 1 ) fineness and 2 ) long staple vs short staple . the construction also contributes to feel and utility greatly , but t-shirts are usually a type of knit ( vs weave ) the video covers fineness a bit . in addition to contributing to hand feel it also improves color-fastness . this is because the ratio of surface area to fiber thickness is high and the dye can more fully saturate . staple length : the cotton staple is the fiber and different varieties have different lengths . these fibers are twisted together to create a yarn ( thread ) and then it is knitted into your shirt . long staple fibers can be tangled better because they can twist around each other more times . this means 1 ) you can get finer yarns . and 2 ) you have less hairs poking out of the yarn as there are less fiber ends to create the yarn . both contribute to the smoothness of the yarn . smoother yarn has better hand feel . this height number of tangles also means the yarn strength is better and the smoother yarn means more durable than cheaper yarns ( as with poly ) types of long staple yarn are pima , supima , sea island and egyptian ( high caution on egyptian as there has been a lot of fraud there ) . in my opinion supima is the best , its the same species as pima but better growing methods and its guaranteed usa grown , so better oversight . low staple cotton is generally lower quality crop with less certifications , so it is cheaper . **recommendations** if youre going to get a wool/cotton blend shit , my recommendation is merino/supima blend if you want the best 100% cotton shirt : supima cotton for a cheaper option that is more durable and has wicking and anti wrinkle properties , look for cotton/poly blends . ratios of 60/40 or 70/30 . again my preference would be for supima/poly blend but in general the poly will make the cotton feel softer .",0,train

g5beus,"own your shit weekly - april 21 , 2020a fundamental core principle here is that you are the judge of yourself . this means that you have to be a very tough judge , look at those areas you never want to look at , understand your weaknesses , accept them , and then plan to overcome them . bravery is facing these challenges , and overcoming the challenges is the source of your strength . we have to do this evaluation all the time to improve as men . in this thread we welcome everyone to disclose a weakness they have discovered about themselves that they are working on . the idea is similar to some of the activities in no more mr . nice guy . you are responsible for identifying your weakness or mistakes , and even better , start brainstorming about how to become stronger . mistakes are the most powerful teachers , but only if we listen to them . think of this as a boxing gym . if you found out in your last fight your legs were stiff , we encourage you to admit this is why you lost , and come back to the gym decided to train more to improve that . at the gym the others might suggest some drills to get your legs a bit looser or just give you a pat in the back . it does not matter that you lost the fight , what matters is that you are taking steps to become stronger . however , dont call the gym saying hey , someone threw a jab at me , what do i do now ? . we discourage reddit puppet play-by-play advice . also , **don ' t blame others for your shit . ** this thread is about you finding how to work on yourself more to achieve your goals by becoming stronger . finally , a good way to reframe the shit to feel more motivated to overcome your shit is that after you explain it , rephrase it saying how you will take concrete measurable actions to conquer it . the difference between complaining about bad things , and committing to a concrete plan to overcome them is the difference between beta and alpha . gentlemen , own your shit .",0,train

( this is what she did ) my takeaway : im boring and predictable . i alsoforce the sexual experience instead of letting it unfold ( as mentioned in nmmng and twotsm ) . 2 . ( next day ) i told her that she could leave if she didnt want to participate as a family . she left and came back multiple times that day . hysterical each time . i told her i wanted her gone , and to go take a walk for a few hours . my takeaway/actions : i acted like a bitch by giving her an ultimatum . what i mean by this is that i should not have to coax and threaten someone into doing something i want them to doespecially when it comes to participating in my family . my wife is showing me that i am not where i \*thought\* i was with my own mentality . she did threaten divorce , and i called her on her bluff . so , i may bengaf , but i still have a ways to go with frame . 3 . i have backed off . i had a covert contract with myself . half covert contract , half pride and ownership . i was still looking for approval from mommy , and it was showing up in other areas . i reset and have reevaluated wtf i was doing and how i was going about it . i realize that , despite me getting stronger , trying to be more awesome and happy , etc . i was just , slowly , building a covert contract . i didnt have a complete meltdown and light the dynamite , but ( almost ) everything i was doing was for the wrong reasons despite my good intentions . action plan : okay , so im reading sidebar , im lifting , and im stfu . im a whole lot better than i was when i started , but im still a shithead faggot , eating paint . 1 . i am realizing i will fail at this shit , and thats okay . whats important is to learn and keep pushing forward . i wanted to dump my whole marriage this passed weekend , but that wouldve been the easy way out . keep pushing . 2 . learn from these experiences . as david deida says , what is my woman trying to teach me here ? what can i learn from the feminine ? how can i find my more masculine source , ( who the fuck i really am ) through my life experiences with my woman , career , world , etc . ? 3 . lead myself first , please myself first . my needs come first . **kids : ** my middle son is a mommys boy . my fault . i have not spent enough time with him , giving him the attention and love he deserves . this ( probably ) explains why he sucks his thumb , insists on sleeping next to mom , and defers to her authority . ive backed off of using my forceful way of getting him to do what i want him to do . in a lot of ways , ive used similar tactics with my wife , on him ( ultimatums , threats , etc . ) well , the shit doesnt work . **further thoughts : ** >further thoughts : i ' m finding less and less ' shit ' to own . ~~maybe i ' m not looking hard enough ? ~~ **i wasnt . this hole im in is deeper than i thought . ** im working on my mission now and getting back into my masculine by meditating and asking myself what i truly want from life , irrespective of family and expectations held by family members . im digging deep and trying to get to the bottom of the question of who am i . i see my woman as a representation of the feminine . as such , i have a lot to learn from her and learn about myself as i interact with her moods . i will dance with the feminine instead of seeking to control it . pain is weakness leaving the body . onward .",0,train

see my daughter at all until i get an urgent court application ( assuming i do at this time ) . if i dont push it she feels like she has won and will be encouraged to do this in the future . i have talked to lawyers ( two to triangulate what im being told ) im finding the whole thing extremely frustrating . i dropped daughter off the other day and ex brought it all up in front of her . i said dont talk about it in front of daughter and she kept going at me while i got in car and drove off . * so what am i doing firstly i stopped . i was getting caught up in ego , then i considered a proper time perspective , in 2 years this will all be locked down legally and ill have most of what i want . so , while it is frustrating and i want to do something the right play is to wait it out ( mediation ) then have an urgent application ready to go . i will not stop the money during this time although i legally could , it would look like im retaliating . previously i had in my mission ( and it came back this week because i felt like writing it ) be a man i respect that man would see the frustration and let it pass over him , he would not react to petty ego games to get a short term ego win at the expense of what he really wants in the medium term . he would not forget to think about 2 years from now because something is happening 2 minutes from now . so that is what im doing , its

remember . ex is being annoying but i am in a strong position because i have done the work to get myself here . life is only going to get better because im going to keep doing the work to make it

the moment and doing what i should do which would progress me towards my goals but does not feel good and goes against some internal resistance . * following [u/tyred\_biggums] ( <url> ) comment last week i have been thinking about shame/needy partners and selfishness . im not sure what i want to do for me , i did the nmmng activity on this and have a few items . most of these dont raise any issues e . g . i want to do a rally driving course and probably will . but there are a few that get to other issues . one is own a nice car , buying myself a nice car seems selfish because you could spend that money on the greater good . im not sure 100% where this comes from but my parents have a part . i imagine my dad being disappointed in my decision . im clearly still not living in my own frame if im worried about things like that in the first place . also , looking at shame and picking needy women i think they are two separate issues that feed into each other . i pick needy women because it makes me feel safe , they need me and so i dont have to worry . i feel shame because i feel like having any needs is wrong and will result in love being taken away , i am defective just by having needs . this feels so typical nice guy that i kept looking for something else but that is what it is . i try to have no needs , i dont inconvenience , i am always trying to do the right thing , when you combine that with picking a needy women and a fear of being alone you get my relationships and my codependency issues . * im not sure why i am so worried about being lonely/alone . sometimes i find mrp very nihilistic and feel empty , im still not sure what to replace that with . i go camping on my own quite a bit and feel happy and fine when im doing that but with others i still chase something from that connection that i cant ever get . i need to spend more time thinking about this . or maybe i dont , maybe i just want to have a nice car a fuck a pair of 19 year olds im not sure

foys6m,"musings on a msm ' s journey towards masculinity . me : 26 years old , teacher , living in a big but not huge city . i am writing this post to share my experience as a ' gay ' man , particularly my experience in the last couple years of beginning to embrace and explore my masculinity . i was an effeminate boy . i ' ve pondered my upbringing and the origins of my homosexuality/my former gay-ness ( i use homosexuality to refer to instincts , gayness to refer to identity and behavior ) . my father was not entirely absent , but he was an impulsive , self-centered , and often-absent alcoholic that in large degree parented by compensating with money , presents , and promises . my mother doted upon me and i was her little boy . both of my parents loved me in their own way , but i had very little positive masculine guidance and role modeling in my youth . i had many friends , both male and female , in elementary school , though by sixth grade or so my associations with other males began decreasing , and after entering middle school essentially completely stopped . once i entered puberty , all my friends were females or other gay/queer males . this state continued until about a year and a half ago . beneath this was a troubled relationship with men and masculinity . i was sexually and emotionally drawn to masculinity , yet also afraid of most men ( particularly masculine ones , and above all straight , masculine men ) . i experienced constant cognitive dissonance about my masculinity , femininity , and sexuality . i had lots of shame and self-loathing . i thought of myself as better than men i observed doing ' guy stuff ' and had disdain for dudes being dudes , men being men . i began having sex at seventeen years old , primarily with older men i met on dating apps . i spent several years frequently having mostly mediocre to poor sex with older men ( 25-40 ) i today would have absolutely no interest in . i engaged in risky behaviors , put myself in dangerous situations repeatedly , and shied away from , botched , or rationalized away the majority of attempts with guys my own age i was genuinely interested in . almost everyone i dated or fucked i met online . i watched lots of porn , sometimes quite extreme stuff , and spent years and years masturbating and ejaculating alone , daily . of course , life is diverse and we traverse and are traversed by many different things . despite and throughout a lot cognitive dissonance and confusion , in many ways i followed my passions and instincts , said fuck you to society ' s and everyone ' s expectations , and did what i wanted . a turning point came a couple years after graduating from university . i was living in australia and had spent eight months living a lot of anger , jealousy , social incompetence , low self-esteem , etc . a few months before leaving i withdrew and reevaluated . for the first time in my life , i made fitness a priority . i also began two experiments that changed my life and brought me towards manhood : i began restoring my foreskin , and i stopped jerking off and cumming for the first time . i came back to the united states and spent a while confronting demons . in the past two years living here again , i ' ve gone through professional , personal , romantic/sexual , and life experiences . i ' ve fucked up and i ' ve succeeded . a year and a half ago i began working as part of an all-male team , and six months ago began looking at the threads for red pill and semen retention . this was the first time in my adult life that i have socialized in all-male environments ( outside the gay world ) . i have learned : \- there ' s no such thing as ' sheeple ' / ' woke ' , beta/alpha , basic/not-basic . there is passive , non-aware submission to the flow of the world , and active consciousness . we all embody both , just to different degrees . everyone is moving at some pace or another either towards or away from more active consciousness . \- i am a man . i am sexually attracted to other men , but i am in a male body , not a female . my personality contains feminine elements . i spent many years pushing down , ignoring , and rejecting my masculinity . \- i wasted vast amounts of energy for years on bad sex , shooting my load onto my belly or a t-shirt , and fantasizing about the people i want to be . i am filled with creative , masculine , and powerful energy that i want to use to conceive of ideas , create things , improve myself , and realize goals with . \- semen retention is a powerful way to cultivate and build energy to do things in life . abstaining from sex , masturbation , and ejaculating has brought me emotional and physical growth , and the longer i go , the more i feel unexcited sexually and romantically by people not interested in self-improvement , goals , and big things , and the smaller grow my neediness for validation through emotional/romantic/sexual attention etc . the longer i go , the more i actively ask myself : why ? why do you want to date/fuck/log onto a dating app/go to a bar etc ? what are you looking for ? , and the more i respond and act in a way that is in line with my principles . \- fitness is a beautiful masculine pastime and is indispensable for all guys to explore manhood . \- i was traumatized by circumcision and tugging on the skin of my dick to grow a new foreskin has been a powerful way to claim autonomy , independence , and manhood . \- i no longer identify as gay . neither do i identify as bisexual or queer . i feel sexually attracted to men in a more visceral , physical way than i am to women , but it is something deeper than the physical that truly draws me , and it is present in both men and women . \- it is not that i am not attracted to women , it is that 1 ) i am bored by overly-feminine women ( and men ) with unbalanced gender energy ie helpless woman with clown makeup , cloying mannerisms , and little to no initiative 2 ) my effeminacy , self-loathing , and socialization as a ' gay man ' in my past led me to think of myself as incapable/unworthy of being masculine enough to be the man for a woman , to be her captain , to be the one in charge/stronger/more framed etc . \- gay culture is filled with hyper-feminine , passive men out of touch with their masculinity . the gay world is filled with men that chase heterosexual traditions and norms to have kids , live in the suburbs , etc . there are also many masculine , well-rounded gay/bi/queer men that combine femininity and masculinity in their personalities . \- gay relationships and sex always include a masculine/feminine dynamic - submissive and dominant , bottoms and tops , male and female roles , listeners and talkers , etc . \- successful and interesting women are not only excitingly , tantalizingly , and beautifully feminine , they also integrate and cultivate masculinity within themselves and use it when it necessary to make money , realize their goals , raise their children , and engage in great relationships . the best women do this so well that men don ' t even notice . \- the future belongs not to ' alpha ' men or the most womanly of women , it belongs to independent minds that combine both genders into something greater , while playing masterfully the game their gender and body challenges them to play . \- on a biological level men and women engage in relationships to procreate . the rest is cultural and societal . if you ' re not fucking and dating to produce kids , what are you doing ? if it ' s not about offspring , the best relationships are about exploring personality , learning , and combining forces to create things and achieve goals . it ' s fun to be the solid masculinity femininity leans on , and to be the pliant , social femininity for masculinity to explore itself with; i ' ve done both . in the long run , though , if two minds want to build a life ( or an interesting time ) together , both have to grow out of such a gendered relationship and just be two individuals cooperating , to some extent within the gender of their body , but to a greater extent as something beyond a penis and a vagina . \- as a ' gay ' man , there is no reason for me to chase heteronormative gender roles . there is no need for me to find a wife , have two kids , buy a house in the suburbs , and fuck men on the side every now and again . there is no need for me to perform the manly man for a submissive gay man ( or vice versa ) , buy a house together and pretend to be man , wife , and kids et al . , nor is there a need for us to buy an apartment together and spend our life trying to convince ourselves that we ' love ' one another and that the romantic myths everyone else is chasing have come true for us . \- masculinity isn ' t necessarily about fucking bitches/lots of guys , making lots of money , and being muscular , though for many it is , and will be . masculinity is about being the fullest version of yourself as possible .",0,train

gc8ydl,"i have been doing cold approach for 2 years now : this is how i went from kissless handholdless virgin to 15 lays in 1 month& # x200b; about 3 years ago , i was a 29 year old asian guy with only a couple months to go before i turned 30 , working at a big 3 accounting firm , and i was realizing that i was unhappy and miserable , working long hours at all times of the day and night and spending all my free time playing overwatch , and dota 2 and despite earning good money , i had a house and some savings , i just knew my life was nowhere near where i wanted it to be or thought it should be , despite all the years of hard work because i was forever alone . i was still a virgin at age 29 . a kissless handholdless virgin i just wanted to take the time to finally get this off my chest since i have nothing better to do during the quarantine . i soon decided , with the help of an epiphany while reading an article on redpill titled how to get laid like a warlord that this was not the life for me and that i would need to start approaching girls and learning game to have any hope of losing my virginity before 30 i didn ' t want to become a 100+ lay gigachad like the article outlined : * i just wanted to experience what other guys experienced in college that i missed out on . * i just wanted to have someone i could share my hopes and struggles with , someone i could come home to and hug if i had a bad day . * i just wanted to have some fun before i get married and start a family was that really too much to ask ? so i quickly began to learn about game and seduction and browsed reddit and other forums almost daily to get hyped up and learn how to do cold approach . i soon discovered , however , that i had bitten off far more than i could chew i met up with a white guy i met online who seemed equally as motivated as me to go out and approach and we went out to several bars and clubs together . every time we went out , he would always go home with a new girl , mostly asian girls im not proud of it , but i was extremely jealous since none of these girls gave me any kind of iois or other signs of attraction when i approached , and stopped going out with him . now , i realize it ' s because he went to the gym a lot and always had a nice haircut , but back then , it was kind of ridiculous how id approach girl after girl and get one word answers and a go away vibe the entire conversation and he would come in a few minutes later and the same girl would be smiling and asking him questions about himself , it felt like he didnt even need to do any work to get laid at this point , i was watching pickup videos from or reading articles on how to get girls on an almost daily basis , trying to study and learn all the latest game techniques . it felt like i hit a brick wall . this was sooo much harder than i thought it would be . the how to get laid like a warlord article specifically said that women would rather fuck an ugly guy with a strong frame than a handsome guy with a weak one but that didnt seem to be the case . i was a 55 asian guy competing with 60+ white guys at every club i went to and it felt like no matter what i said , no girls were even willing to have an actual conversation with me . this is after 100+ approaches so i knew that it wasnt just bad luck or lack of effort . so reluctantly , after learning some valuable lessons about the harsh nature of reality , i invested $2997 in a well known pickup bootcamp since i figured i was already watching so many of their videos , and its only fair that i pay them and hopefully learn how to break through my sticking points since my strategy of trying to learn everything by myself was clearly failing . for those of you thinking about going to a pua bootcamp , be very careful you don ' t waste all your money like i did . this particular company did not give a single fuck about me other than my money . my instructor just kept telling me to approach and approach , which i already knew how to do , and every time i asked for feedback on why none of the girls seemed receptive , he would give some bullshit feedback on how my vibe was off . i asked him how to correct it and he never had any real answers , always giving some woo woo answer about how i needed to have outcome independence and have more fun . it was really weird that everyone who seemed to succeed seemed to be the type to go to the gym a lot and pay a lot of attention to their physical appearance , even though they teach that looks don ' t matter . i finally lost my virginity through sheer luck after over 500 approaches . it was a fat and ugly latina girl who was so drunk she didnt know where she was and i just happened to be there to help her home but it still counts . at this point , i was so desperate that i tried to go out on dates with her and become her boyfriend but she stopped responding to my texts after the second date over the next couple of years , i became obsessed with getting good with girls , which certainly kept me going , but it also caused some problems i went out with so many wingmen , hoping to find that gold nugget , that shining piece of knowledge or wisdom that would finally catapult me past this unbreakable wall , but they would either be just as bad with girls as me or be over 5 ' 10 "" , no exceptions . i read an article on reddit about how you had to talk louder and slower and that actually helped a lot . girls would actually give me a chance to have a conversation with them instead of rejecting me immediately but they would still shake their head when i asked them to go home with me or even just grab a drink together . that ' s when it hit me that i didn ' t know as much as i thought i did and that there was a lot more to learn . the bad news is , all this rejection was not good for my mental health . i started to wonder if maybe a short asian guy like myself is just not meant to procreate i was seriously considering moving to thailand or the philippines to try to at least find a gold digger wife but finally , i found one particular dating coach that really resonated with me and i immersed myself in his training he was 57 and asian , so a short asian like me . the first thing he told me was that my hairstyle , fashion , and body language were all shit and unless i fix them first , nothing else would work . now this is completely contradictory to some of the other advice i read like the how to get laid like a warlord article which convinced me that looks dont matter but i decided to give it a shot . i got a blazer and chinos from zara and got an undercut haircut with faded sides along with a gold watch . i didnt expect anything to happen right away but the difference in girls reactions really was noticeable immediately . suddenly , they would hang in and listen to every word i had to say instead of just politely waiting for me to leave . one girl even started asking me questions about myself and followed me when i asked her to grab a drink with me ! i was sooo happy , it felt like everything changed . next , he told me to fix my posture and stand up perfectly straight with no neck or back tilt . this was really hard for me because i spent my entire adult life playing video games and working in front of a computer , always hunched over . i even had to go to a chiropractor to undo the years of bad habits and damage to my posture but it finally got fixed after i started wearing a back brace like they give to scoliosis patients . again , i noticed immediate results . i actually pulled a girl home this time and got a blowjob ! no lay thought because of last minute resistance the one thing that really transformed my results though was to speak to girls with vocal variety . i had a very monotone voice that didnt change in volume or pitch at all . he had me watch episodes of f . r . i . e . n . d . s and we noticed that every character spoke with such vocal variety and inflections that it sounded like they were speaking in color compared to my black and white . this did not come easy but i worked had on it until it was at least somewhat passable . this turned out to be the tipping point and i finally started getting laid regularly when i go out instead of once every 500 approaches like before . overall , i ' m very happy to have fucked 15 girls . i know that ' s not a lot compared to some other guys on here but it ' s a big improvement over zero . thats kind of the level im at right now . the girls arent like model level 9s or 10s yet but ive gotten a 7 before , mostly 5s and 6s but its a massive improvement over nothing . the quarantine obviously put approaching on hold but luckily , i already had a plate i was regularly seeing before shit hit the fan , so im not wanting for sex , just spending my days reading and learning as much as i can about working out and nutrition since i got fatter from the quarantine and plan on hitting the gym as soon as things open back up . hope everyone reading this is safe and got some value from my post . just needed to get this off my chest before work starts up again .",1,train

foxxb9u,"i am in a similar situation except i have not been able to find a support group . my views are too "" radical "" for my home country and "" not relevant "" to my adoptive country . it ' s great to know you have found some relatedness . where do you think would be the appropriate place for expats to express their feelings on feminism ? i feel like i can only support local ( i . e . of my adoptive country ) feminism and not actively suggest things as i did not experience sexism in the same way as them .",0,test
foyaejn,"i think there are similar experiences that can be shared with local feminist groups as an expat . a common , unifying theme for me has been experiences in the workplace . ive come to also realize , sadly , that i cannot expect all feminists to be intersectional . i had a wonderful feminist advisor ( who i still respect ) who recoiled when i started talking about racial microaggression . i very much wish i could discuss feminism with women from my own cultural background who are also expats . i have not cracked the code for this yet .",0,test
foy94rd,"i totally understand what you feel . but its also important to realise that intersectionality in feminism is so important . the fact that we mostly read and discuss western feminism is a part of the post colonial discourse . there is a still a soft culture in academia about the western understanding of feminism . and the fact that we often feel alienated from the discussions in our home as well as overseas is because we dont take multitudes of lived realities into account . even if we do , we dont hear much about it and its often exoticized and seen as something bizarre in the west . its so frustrating because women from third world countries are assumed to achieve the feminist discourse in the west . the cultural nuances are completely disregarded . the collective voices of women from the third world heard . there is need to engage with lived experiences of multitude of women from diverse cultures and classes . patriarchy affects us all but it affects some more disproportionately than others . feminism at the outset should account for this . so , we dont feel an outsider in a struggle that is for all the women around the world !",0,train
foyrxlb,"as a white intersectional feminist who has a number of poc loved ones , some of whom are from colonised countries or simply countries with very different backgrounds , i recognise this isnt my place to respond to , but i hope i can welcome you ( as a migrant , i know moving country and splitting your time between countries can be difficult in ways there arent words for; please know at least other ex-pats get it ) and share some things ive found helpful , for what theyre worth . i have found civil rights leaders from all sorts of movements but especially anti-racist and anti-colonialist movements super inspiring . womanists , the largely black poc women who led the intersectional movement , guided my growth and understanding of how to act right , and all errors i make are my own . i found treating the women that grew up rooted in sexism with respect paid dividends . women have always found ways to live around sexism , whether they acknowledged it or not . even the most hide-bound culture has ways for people to let off steam . it may not be worth preserving , necessarily , but it is worth understanding . you may find that you are the person best placed to write or speak about feminism in your home country , or intersectionality in your adopted country . but you dont have to do anything , and you are not alone , not ever . even if there are few out and out feminists in your home country , there are surely more women who are sympathetic to it; native feminists in your adoptive country may not understand directly , but if theyre half decent and your friends theyll set themselves to understanding . some groups i think you might have luck feeling at home with are 1 ) other women who have migrated from your home to your adopted country; 2 ) feminists from countries neighbouring or similar to your home country; 3 ) groups of immigrant feminists , without specific countries of origin , because some experiences are common . a very modern experience is trying to make friends with a number of different groups so as to satisfy the aches and needs that arise in us . its a very lonely world ( and perhaps foolish ) but one hopes we can work on that , too .",0,train

"" ;* 3 - seeing so many men suffering from this exact way ( and it not need mattering if a man is a 2/10 or a 10/10 . suffering from women is human condition on heterosexual men , it seems ) and ourselves just being tired of trying and being better ourselves everyday to reach that goal of having everlasting love with a woman , we reach a conclusion : *something is definitely not right about relationships/women nowadays* ( otherwise there wouldn ' t be so many niche groups like mgtow/men ' s rights/whereareallthegoodmen . it ' s reactionary and even error theory assuming that "" *we ' re all losers and incels "" . correlation doesn ' t mean causation* , however , when that correlation continues to go on without stopping , a conclusion has to be made ) ; 4 - with such a conclusion , we go searching for more information : we find books ( the manipulated men , the rational male , the works of briffault ) , we find articles ( divorce rapes , cheating scandals , emotional bullying cases ) , and , eventually , this kind of subreddit , mgtow ( maybe trp ) . with the axioms that these subreddits apply . . . well , they just make sense . everything fits . we start to connect the pieces . briffaults ' s law , hypergamy , monkey branching , abandoning relationships for no reason , shit tests . . . it ' s impossible for this to be just me ! every guy i ' ve known has suffered through the exact same way . so we start talking to our male friends . . . and we all agree on these premisses . 5 - we , naturally , keep reading and being informed about this . we start living without the necessity of having a girlfriend , a woman in our lives , and just stop ( or limit ) our necessity of approaching women . we start to live more . we are more sane . we are healthier ( some of us even go to the gym ! ) . we start taking care of ourselves for ourselves . we start not caring about social media . 6 - now that we are a better person and know these truths about modernity , and are simply better not caring about women ( although this is really difficult and only a select few can outright not have that human condition pull on women ) , we start not giving a crap . women start complaining that we are not paying attention or that we have become lazy . feminism and social media start using debilitating words like *incel , loser* or *beta* to shame test us ( like we haven ' t predicted that by this point ) . you know , a typical strawmen/ad hominem . 7 - the cycle repeats here . now , with our knowledge about this concern , we appropriate other males that give attention to other females to have sexual needs validated ( onlyfans , twitch girls , youtube girls , e-girls ) and call them by reason , to wake them up . "" why do you think that onlyfans exploded ? it ' s not because they can ' t get employability or good jobs . it ' s not because it ' s "" difficult "" out there . prosmicuity and sexual themes have exploded in the past decade , and females are the bread winner . they can have their cake and eat it . they can have more sexual partners and be paid for it , without having any beneficial labour for the rest of society . they can go on any social dating app and just pick . *you are not going to have sex with her* .

fp5avjk,"gf- cooks on special dates wife- organises most meals ( depending on how chores are split ) and shares grocery/meal prep plans with their partner . gf- helps pick out a sofa or curtains by making suggestions or comes along for the shopping trip wife- equal vote on interior design . empathises with partners preferences they come to a compromise gf- does laundry as a sweet gesture wife- has a laundry schedule that fits the partnership gf- splits meals , he sometimes pays , no financial commitment to each other wife- comingled finances and a long term financial plan just a few examples . hope this helps .",0,train

ga4zsx,"why i love my husband[why i love my husband ] ( <url> ) he leads me in the faith- he had a proven track record *before* i met him . before i met him; my husband he was active in ministry in his previous church . once that church had dispensed he has committed to attending another church weekly . he has always given faithfully to the church and has supported various missions . he is also sponsoring a child . after i met him; his commitments did not change . since before we were engaged he brought me along to his church and introduced me to his church family . he has supported me in supporting the missions i am involved in financially and also agreed with my request for us to contribute more to the church . he has continued sponsoring a child ( which he did not advertise to me , but i noticed when i saw a letter from world vision ) . now we are married; we attend church weekly together . every night in bed he reads his bible next to me before we sleep . he also has a youtube channel where he creates sermon jams . he has never over promised or broken a promise . the first time i met my husband he kissed me on the cheek and opened the car door for me , the door swung back and closed , but by that time he was half way around the car . he cringed hard and tried to brush it off . from that first meeting forward he always opened my car door when coming to pick me up and closed it behind me . i would always giggle and insist he never had to do that and it was ridiculous to keep up , but on this occasion and on many he said ill never do anything for you that i cant keep up . and it was true . he never over promised , he never over extended , he never spoilt me to woo me in the beginning then became tight later on . his spending , his actions towards me and his love for me never spiked then fell . he opened up the car door for me until we got married and started living together , so i open up my car door now ( partly on my insistence , haha ) . after becoming ill and battling chronic illness , he started opening the door for me again when i was too weak . this is a small example of how he has stayed consistent . he doesnt lie to me- he tells me what he likes and gives me the means to submit to his preferences . i always used to joke with my husband why dont you just lie to me ? ! i dont want to know ! when he told me things i did not want to hear . i was joking , partly , as my sinfulness wanted an easy life and a man that told me what i wanted . well , through gods grace to me , im married to a man that is so honest to me , sometimes it is confrontational . he doesnt like above the knee jean shorts , he thinks theyre hideous . he doesnt like t-shirt dresses , he thinks theyre equally hideous ( two things i wore often ) , he doesnt like long skirts on me , he doesnt like short hair etc . . . etc . . . it might sound picky , but its directional and in going against what hes said , that would be the true confrontation . it is unloving to do something you know your partner does not like . my husband spoke to me and suggested we go shopping . he encouraged me to dress like some of the girls my age and that how they dress would suit me a lot ( can you imagine hearing this without a humble heart ? ) but he has never brought something up without his support and means to fix the issue . so , he takes me shopping . wow , look at my hot fianc ! ( we were engaged at the time ) it made me feel admired and loved , it was amazing to see his reaction and how happy he was every time i skipped out to his car wearing the clothes he bought me . in saying that , we didnt buy anything i wasnt comfortable in , a few pairs of jeans , white sneakers , multiple t shirts of the same colour- so simple but he loved it , and i loved him even more for telling me . ive bought many husband approved dresses since , which he adores . he has clear standards for me . he introduced me to his friends , family and church . in his vetting process of me , he let me have his real personality from the beginning . he made things clear how he liked it and as we interacted with other couples , we saw real life examples of how we would and wouldnt want to be like . couple a- my husband is friends with the husband . he cant stand the wife . shes overweight , unkind and screams at her husband in public . my hubby was very clear at his distain for her and never pretended to like her even in front of her . he was blunt and didnt go out of his way to acknowledge her . it was clear he did not respect her . i never wanted that to be me . couple b- my husband did ministry for a long time with the husband of this couple . his wife was sweet , feminine and absolutely lovely . she was kind and warm to me when i was an outsider in the group . she was respectful of her husband and it showed in everything they did together . she was thin and dressed well . my husband enjoyed our time a lot with this couple and told me how much he respected their relationship . he would say things like theyre the real deal i think its amazing shes kept in shape so well after having a child by this feedback , and seeing how he treated these different types of people , and on top of that , knowing how consistent he is as a person , i knew how not to act . his health/ my health he has made it clear that cooking at home needs to be healthy . my husband goes to the gym 5-6 days a week and eats the same thing for lunch everyday . i would push him sometimes for him to let me prepare him lunch , but he insistent that is what he will eat everyday and it is what is best for his health . we go shopping together and buy the food i will cook together . i buy ingredients he likes and ingredients that are healthy . he has told me he wants veggies in his diet , so thats what i cook . he wants high protein meals , so thats what i cook . i make sure i have the ingredients for all the meals he could want ( to a point ) so he has the freedom to ask for what he wants for dinner . he has made what he wants clear . he does not allow us to eat take away more than once a week . he is hyper aware of his body ( i always catch him tensing in front of the mirror , haha ) and is hyper aware of my body . hes made it clear he does not want me to gain any weight and that the weight i am right now is the largest he would like me ( im 58kg , 54 ) he has also found the most hilarious way to let me know im gaining weight wow honey , look how big your breasts are ! makes me laugh thinking about it . with his help , ive stayed pretty much the same weight since meeting him . him being honest about his absolute disgust for fat people has helped- and its a mutual thing . i wouldnt ever let him gain weight and i have his support back . he takes care of me and brings me security financial security; my husband sought to get a stable job and savings before he put himself on the market to be married . by the time i met him , he had a deposit saved for a house and a job that was recession proof . he made it clear to me that is getting a house together would require me working full time until we were ready for kids . he told me it would be difficult and that he would support me in this . god provided me a job that is close to home and my husband drives me every morning . ( currently not working due to covid ) health; during our engagement i had a trip to the er . it turned out i had a cyst on my ovary , we did not realise the health hurdles we would be tackling in the next year and a half because of it . 5 more trips to the er , specialist and doctors appointments , iud insertions and a surgery later , im still on the mend and take pain killers to manage in the meantime . this is a chronic condition called endometriosis . i never , ever expected my husband to be so supportive and unconditionally loyal . i remember on one trip to the hospital i was passing out in the passengers seat and vomiting . in my moments of consciousness i looked to my husband and he kept saying dont worry baby , we are almost there , its going to be ok . i trusted him and let the anxiety go . its a blurr but i ended up in a hospital bed getting emergency pain relief . he waited with me in the hospital the entire day . this happened quiet a few more times . after my operation i went back to the er and we waited in the horrible waiting room chairs for 8 hours through the early hours of the morning . everytime i looked at him i wanted to cry out of gratitude , i felt so horrid and he was right there with me . i can not believe the level of empathy and maturity he has shown to me when i was in 10/10 pain . in my moments of absolute weakness and exhaustion , so much so i couldnt cry out to god , he would put his hand on me and pray for me . he puts me first before his family . we come from a traditional culture where the mothers tend to baby their sons . i love my mil to death and i dont mind her asking questions , but my husband without hesitation always shuts everyone down if they question how i am at home . does anna cook for you everyday ? he will respond along the lines of why does it matter ? she can do as she likes shes the cook of the home . oh , poor anna , she cant speak our language he will respond what do you mean poor anna ? shes a lion . you should be the one learning english . he will shut down any conversation that is not kind to me , he does not complain about me to his family nor friends . he will not let his friends joke about our sex life . he does not let me overextend myself for the sake of his family even though i am extremely willing to . he tells me and has the strong belief that our immediate family unit ( him and me ) are most important and everything else is secondary . we of course love his family a lot , especially his parents , but hes made it clear we wont partake in anything just for the sake of tradition . bonus points : -he gets along amazingly with my dad , we all hang out all the time and its the best part of my life ! -his family love me ( they joke constantly they love me more than they love him ! ) -he is good with children and loves his nephews , we even baby set sometimes . -he grew his beard for me .",0,train

gb2cnw,"the 80/20 concept is inherently flawed , based on data that doesn ' t represent the population , and selectively ignores parts of that data that make men look bad . i ' m a guy . i like a lot of what trp has to offer . it helped put words to things i had felt and experienced for a long time . but it ' s very clear that certain pieces of trp wisdom have spent far too long in the echo chamber and become dogmatized and mythologized beyond all rational sense as a result . the 80/20 concept is a prime example of this . i often see it referred to as the 80/20 "" rule , "" and see guys use it to show that 20% of all men are chads running a harem . the 80/20 rule is , so far as i can tell , based of a combination of a misappropriated pareto principle and some very selective data pulled from [tinder] ( <url> ) and [okcupid] ( <url> ) . the most glaring issue with treating 80/20 as a rule for romantic interaction generally is that the data isn ' t based on the general population - it ' s based on data extracted from two very specific dating sites . the best you can say is that it applies on tinder and okcupid . that does not therefore mean it applies to the general population . a small percentage of the population use these apps . they are a product . they attract a certain kind of person , often for a specific purpose . tinder dynamics =/= dating dynamics . the tinder study is so flawed it ' s hardly worth looking at . it ' s based off the self-reported data of 27 women . 27 . millions of women on the app , and only 27 were interviewed . so beyond not being representative of the general population , that study isn ' t even representative of tinder . the okcupid data is a bit more solid . what does it show ? well there are a few things to note : yes , it appears women on okcupid are pretty brutal in regards to how they rate the attractiveness of males . 80% of men on okcupid were rated as below "" medium "" attractiveness . but again , this isn ' t an analysis of dating in general - this is an analysis of how women on okcupid rate men on okcupid . it ' s possible that women on okcupid are just pickier about looks compared to the general population . it ' s possible men on okcupid are just uglier than the general population . it ' s possible they just aren ' t good at dressing , grooming , and taking good profile pictures ( and having looked over the shoulder of female friends as they swiped , i can confirm there ' s a lot of dudes who probably look pretty decent but absolutely suck as presenting themselves well ) . 20% of men were rated as above average . i ' ve often seen this "" study "" used to confirm that 20% of men "" get "" 80% of the women . that ' s nonsense . and here ' s why : what trp conveniently omits from this analysis is that while the women were pretty brutal in terms of who they rated as physically attractive , women also largely went on to initiate contact with that same block of men they just rated as physically below average . look at the graph . in terms of who women are actually willing to pursue they basically the opposite of picky in regards to looks . arguably this is evidence that women are *not* particularly shallow - they have high standards when it comes to looks , but other things in a guys profile - humor , career , charisma , hobbies - prompt them to contact these men . what about guys ( *on okcupid ) * ? well we ' re much more fair about attractiveness ratings . it ' s a nice bell curve peaking right around "" medium , "" although i have to imagine the thought process here went something like "" mm . . . boobs . . . hot . . . "" but who do guys ( *on okcupid ) * contact ? that same study that "" proves "" 80/20 found that two thirds of all male attention is focused on the top one third of women . so why isn ' t there a 66/33 rule ? well because that would make men look like shallow horndogs drooling after only the hottest of the hottest women who are way out of their league and then complaining when they strike out . it would make men look bad . so trp ignores it , rather than codifying it as a rule for all human interaction the same way they did with the data on women . well that ' s not quite correct - they only did this with the data that makes women look bad . the part that shows that women happily initiate contact with far more than just the top 20% conveniently gets omitted from this "" rule . "" finally , just on a common sense level , one fifth of all men are not chads . think of any time you ' ve seen a pretty random subset of the population , have *one in five* of the men present been jacked , jawlined , charismatic pussy-slayers ? no . not even close . probably more like 1-2% . and do these men get a lot of sex ? yes . do they probably get sex from the hottest women ? yes . does this mean there ' s no sex available for everyone else ? not even close . a majority of men report having multiple sexual partners over the course of their lives - the 0-1 category is a minority and , considering that many religious people who weren ' t trying to get laid before marriage are in the 1 category , it ' s probably even smaller . only between 12-14 percent of adults aged 20-24 have never had sex . this number drops to around five percent for adults aged 25-29 , and by age 44 , only around 0 . 3 percent of adults report never having sex . so if your goal is to be able to effortlessly hook up with different hotties five times a week , yeah , sorry , you ' re shit out of luck . that ' s only something chad ( or a very very rich guy ) gets to do . but you don ' t need to be a chad or in the top 20% of men looks-wise to have a normal , happy , healthy sex life , or even to get laid quite a bit . cmv edit : been bouncing this around for hours . seen some moderately compelling evidence against my position , some not . gonna take a break for a bit and i ' ll try to address all the new replies when i get back . cheers and thanks for an enjoyable first post to ppd .",0,test

( her friend ) so what am i doing wrong and how do i become more likeable ? it seems that men dont respect me for whatever reason . are betas more liked by everyone because theyre softer and more agreeable ? i mean im never an asshole to people but im always strong in my convictions and never lie . i thought this would command respect from other people but it doesnt seem to . hmm or maybe thats not it . its just i have this one friend who everyone loves but hes not alpha at all . hes adopted the new age mantra and is all about positive vibes etc . im not like that as im a realist , but im not an asshole either . so i dont get it . what do you think ?",1,train

gdkb6l,"do you think breasts are inherently sexual ? sorry if this sounds a bit scattered , i ' m just writing a stream-of-consciousness about my thoughts on this right now . this question has been haunting me for many years . i remember this one time i was at the beach when i was young and i was watching the boys around me wearing just their swim trunks and how free it must feel not to have to wear a top , and i felt this sort of painful longing . i felt sad that girls just couldn ' t do that , because boobs are "" inappropriate "" . now that i ' m older , i have many more thoughts about this . i still feel the painful longing i felt when i was younger whenever i see men just being allowed to have their shirts off and not have to cover their nipples . and i just wonder , why is it that boobs are seen to be nearly as sexual , if not *just* as sexual , as genitalia ? there is really no difference between male nipples and female nipples except for the female breast ' s function to breastfeed , which requires more fatty tissue . my theory on this is that women ' s bodies are just so objectified and oversexualized in every way that even body parts that seem biologically and inherently sexual really *aren ' t* . rather , everyone in ( at least western ) societies have become socialized to cater to the male gaze , which views women through a lens that hyper-sexualizes women for male benefits . i do not think that female breasts are inherently sexual; rather , our response to viewing breasts in a purely sexual way is a result of being trained over and over and over that breasts are for men ' s sexual viewing pleasure . we have sexualized women ' s breasts so much that women cannot even breastfeed their children in public , a normal biological need , without being hyper-sexualized and condemned . theoretically , i think it is possible for women ' s breasts to be seen as just as nonsexual as men ' s are . it will take many , many years of deconstructing the male gaze and removing men from the position of the "" default "" human being ( thereby removing marginalization ) , but i think it can happen . for the most part , i believe we have a choice of which body parts we choose to sexualize or not sexualize ( besides *maybe* genitalia ) . for instance , biologically , cis straight women overwhelmingly prefer men with larger shoulder to hip ratios , but you do not see men ' s shoulders being covered up and hypersexualized . i do not think that is because men ' s shoulders are actually "" less sexy "" than women ' s breasts; rather , i believe it is because most societies have been designed for men , with men being the "" viewers "" and women being the ones who are viewed . and so , men ' s preferences and decisions on what is "" sexy "" or not have taken precedence and are thought of as being universal , while women ' s desires and what body parts they view as sexy on men are mostly silenced or not recognized to be as sexy as any body part women possess , because women are , as we have been trained , inherently sexual , while men are not . in general , sexualizing women ' s nipples while not sexualizing men ' s nipples creates an imbalance where women are taught to be inherently ashamed of the body they possess because it is automatically "" sexual "" , while men are taught that their body is the normal , default body that is allowed to view women as objects for their sexual viewing pleasure . whoops , this was a lot longer than i meant it to be . but i ' m curious , what are your thoughts on this ? **tldr : ** i believe women ' s breasts are over-sexualized because we have been socialized to view women through a male gaze which believes women ' s bodies to be inherently sexual . this , in turn , sexualizes body parts that are not actually sexual . i think it is theoretically possible to desexualize women ' s breasts in time , when men are no longer deemed to be the "" default "" human and society is not designed solely for men ' s benefits and desires . **edit : ** i also want to add that i am bisexual and nonbinary ( afab ) . while i find women ' s boobs to be sexually attractive , i do not think of boobs *only* in that way and i do not think of women as being inherently sexual objects because of their bodies . i would have no problem living in a world where women can walk around with their tops off , because boobs are beautiful in ways that are more than just sexually , and so are women as a whole . i think boobs are a body part like any other , and they definitely can be sexy , but they are not aggressively inherently sexual and inappropriate like we have been ingrained with . society has an undeniable problem with looking at women as parts rather than as people .",0,train

ggg9qu,"how i succeeded in datingafter reading a lot of hoopla on inner game , flirting and other bs that there is out there , i came to an undeniable conclusion that most of these were full of shit . sure , you could learn something of value from there , but most of it bs . so , i started using my common sense and got success . i started working out . not just because i wanted to date hot girls , but because i wanted to improve my health . this after having a fatal hospitalisation due to liver swelling . i improved my diet , which was now balanced and vegetarian . i did eat boiled eggs for breakfast though . and , i started working out . hired a trainer and started finally . there were many points in time where i simply wanted to run away from gym and sleep in my cozy bed . it was painful , but worth it in the end . now , for a year i have not been sick . not even a cold . secondly , i started visiting a good barber . i can ' t emphasise how important is having a good hair cut . after getting my haircut , i kept going to the same since it is important to go to the same barber for maintaining a good hairstyle . i have specs so i bought a stylish pair of eyewear . thirdly , i improved my fashion sense . i started taking my female friends for shopping my clothes . if you want to attract females , better ask them what suits you . besides , they have a much better fashion sense than males . meanwhile , while executing all this , i started socialising . like just going out there . started chatting up any girls that i liked . initially , i had nerves . i was frantic , nervous . but gradually i started gaining confidence . i read somewhere that when girls reject you , think of it as their loss instead of yours . initially , i will be honest , i got depressed upon rejection . it shattered my confidence , but i kept at it . i had to . and eventually , this benefited me . i became desensitised to rejection . whenever i got rejected , i got a bit sad but moved on . then after some time , i finally got success . hence my confidence increased . but a big part of it was me getting fit . i cannot emphasise the importance of what being fit did to my confidence . no longer had a pot belly . no longer was i skinny . so i would say this , going to gym and being fit will boost your confidence enormously . you do not need to arnold schwarzenegger . just be fit . muscular . don ' t go overboard with it , lol . another thing that has kept me happy in the relationships is : - * i do not dip my pen in crazy ink . * no games . no push pull . be genuinely busy . develop constructive hobbies . develop interests . be an interesting person for the sake of living fullfiling life . not to get chicks . * never pursued a girl that was playing games . i have my self respect intact . no girl is worth losing it . i have a rule about dating . if after first date , the girl does not herself ask for another date or start a conversation , i consider it to be the end of it . never drive single handedly . after some time if a girl is not reciprocating , or is confused . i tell them to make up their mind . * be forth coming once you start dating about what you want . no pussyfooting about what you want . do not be friends if you are attracted . you will end up suffering . * do not be manipulative . do not put a nice guy act . girls can see through it within seconds . they might end up using you and then dumping you before you get anything . * do not stalk . do not be pathetic . no means no . develop a thick skin and learn to move on . tldr : - use your common sense . you do not need a love guru or a dating guide or any other bs .",0,train

gi0g9q,"how to move on and let go ? basically i ' m asking for advice on how to move on and let go of this girl who has been tormenting me in my own head . she lived next door and we quickly became friends as we had a lot in common . at the time i was very bad with girls and had no experience . i quickly developed a crush on her but had no idea to make a move . she would often flirt with me when drunk but i was oblivious and shy at the time . fast forward i grew some balls and started talking to girls and getting with women . this led to me and her eventually hooking up . however she quickly started displaying weird behavior . she would flirt with me all night and then leave with another guy , was constantly hot and cold i thought i was buggin but her friends agreed that this was a habit of hers . i became upset with her and my neediness caused her to end things but i found out that she had lied to me about something else and ended our friendship . she begged me for forgiveness and so i forgave her . the year after we start hooking up again but one night while we ' re walking home she ditches me and sleeps with my best friend who had a gf . he knew i liked and even bragged about lying to her and how bad she wanted him to me and other friends . im beyond upset and tormented . firstly that she would sleep with a guy like that , i usually couldn ' t care who she sleeps with , not that she even needs my permission but it just makes it ten times worse to think that she would sleep with a guy like that . ( fast forward he did something similar to another friend months later but they were actually about to date the girl . ) . obviously this is more of a me problem why does it bother me so much that she ' d sleep with a guy like this . i mean i ' d understand like if the guy was actually charming but he wasn ' t good looking , was narcissistic and a compulsive liar . when i asked her about it she said she was really drunk and him as well , which checks out . but idk if she was drunk enough that she didn ' t know what she was doing . an important part of this story is we never had sex we would always get close but she always claimed she ' d feel bad bc her best friend had a huge crush on me and told her not to . which was true . i think this made it all the more worse as he got something so easily that i had been trying so hard for . but she also had a string of toxic behavior that made me question if this was the real reasoning or if she was just manipulating me , for validation . ( i could never tell although she did seem sincere when she said she did want to sleep with me ) . logically i know this girl and friend aren ' t for me and i should move on from both but their both stuck in my head , its been many months now and time isn ' t helping . i constantly think about the two of them together . and for some strange reason i still want her , no girl has come close . i ' ve had sex with a few more girls since but nothing is filling the gap . i want her out of my head sorry for any grammatical errors and if it seemed like i was jumping around i left out a lot of events to try and get to the point faster .",0,train

fpsl0ss,"are we asking about title ix again ? under title ix , there has to be equal programs with equal funding by the university for all sex exclusive clubs , programs , activities . its not enough that the university just allow one to be created . if they find it , it has to have matched funding . same with promotion . welcome to football massive revenue and rules meant to prevent schools from spending all their money on stadiums for football teams while not even having a volleyball area for this . to me the solution is not about equal numbers at all . however thats the rationale behind stem programs so its useful to criticize other percentages based on that . optimally to me equality of oppurtunity would open doors to stem fields without closing any on anybody . . . . . which includes men wanting to learn stem in a greater proportion then women as is their choice . the problem is that i find their partial solution draconian and they find my solution discriminatory because there is disproportionate interest . this all comes from us having different views on biology of men and women .",0,train

fpt4gd4,">if you disagree with title ix , then do you disagree with its redisbrutive effects on men over time as being unfair or unequal ? i don ' t understand the inner workings of title ix or the american university culture enough to definitively say either way . that ' s why i ' m on record repeatedly saying tit for tat is an absurd approach . either people decide they want utter equality ( sports teams getting the exact same amount regardless of the revenue they generate , or you allow funding to be based on need , popularity , merit , personal interest , and then you have times when men or women don ' t get what the other group does . either we want firm and absolute equality even when it ' s silly , over-reaching and imo , dystopian , or we learn to live in a world where the give and take of all resources is flexible .",0,test
fptb7b6,"i agree with you but let me lay out the problem as i see it : the problem is popular advocacy wants the best of both of these worlds frequently . oh this is a situation where men are outperforming without involvement ? lets redistribute the success ! equality of outcome ! oh this is a situation where women are outperforming men ? well hands off ! freedom to choose ! freedom of association etc ! the issue i have is when you are here defending things with freedom of choice and another person defends stuff with equality of outcome . sometimes both are used by people who only care about womens interest and they either dont understand or act maliciously about how its discriminatory against men . i would select equality of oppurtunity by the way . i am actually against title ix existing , but that means i would want everything it affects including sports to be undone . i would like everything judged by that same standard . the problem is we have lots of areas where we have redistributive policies which benefit women and areas where women have more rights and/or outperform that should arguably be distributed . some examples of redistributive equality policies that benefit women or tend to benefit more women : quotas , child support , alimony , sports payment/scholarships , marriage/divorce laws , female only programs , gym hours . some examples where women have an arguably better deal out of it without any other intervening policy : child custody , paternity laws , womens scholarships , draft , # believewomen , dating , power of sex appeal , fgm/mgm , spending gap you can also list some redistributed policies that favor men ( bathroom lines based on same size bathrooms in public ) you can also add non redistributed policies that people argue should be redistributed ( pay gap , job career choices gap ) i could add more things to all 4 of these areas . the point is that it is common to see freedom of choice arguements made alongside redistributive ones . ( see advocacy for my body my choice and compare it to wage gap ) . however i look at all these issues and notice that redistributive equality and equality of oppurtunity get men shafted on both ends of it currently , frequently . i see current advocacy as using both standards , combined . this is no longer equality but a way to use equality as an arguement of convenience to argue for something above equality . so , when i argue title ix , its not because i believe title ix is the best thing ever , but because i am pointing out the lopsided tendency of advocacy that argues both outcome and oppurtunity . . . picking whichever arguement is convient . the goal should be to pick one standard and work towards it . instead we have the bastardization or arguing as advocacy for women by any standard that can possibly be used to support the arguement . this is why i consider my flair to be the most important thing for advocacy in general . i am not anti woman or pro man . . i am advocating for a consistent standard .",0,train

"" * i ' ve noticed this myself - a huge number of people here ( and in other self-improvement/dating communities ) struggle with taking that first step and actually starting to work on themselves and fix their issues . it ' s easy to read everything on here , buy seduction books/courses , read 100 websites , watch other people hit on girls , feeling that rush of dopamine as you excitedly think , "" it ' s not that hard - i could do it too ! "" but it ' s another thing to actually *do it yourself* . **taking that first step is the hardest step you ' ll ever take . ** other guys feel like it ' s too late for them , or that they ' re "" far too fucked-up "" to ever have any hope of getting laid or finding a girlfriend or being in a happy relationship . they ' ll lurk on here ( maybe even comment every now and then ) , reading everything that ' s posted , but they ' ll never in a billion years even consider for a second that they could be out there making progress themselves . they gave up hope years ago; after all , getting laid is something that ' s reserved for *other people* . i want to share my story , to show you no matter how much of a handicap you ' re starting with , no matter how screwed up your life or your mindset or your head may be - you can turn it all around . it won ' t be easy . it ' ll take a shitload of work - probably years . but it ' s very bloody doable . **i ' ll give the short version of my story : ** i was extremely suicidal from age 14 to 23 . as in , every single day id have fantasies of killing myself . i lost count of the number of times i found myself in the kitchen holding a knife to my wrist , willing myself to have the courage to *finally fucking do it* . i was in 2 abusive relationships , had zero friends , and my life consisted of nothing that really made me happy . i didn ' t think any women would ever truly like me ( my girlfriend at the time hated me , it was a pretty fucked up relationship - we just yelled and screamed at each other all the time ) . i had a job for a bit but i lost it , and that was when things *really* got bad . that job was really the only thing getting me out of the house , and once i no longer had it , i turned to alcohol . i became a raging alcoholic ( was drunk basically 24/7 ) , developed a severe porn addiction ( most days watching 8hrs of porn ) and spent the rest of the time playing video games . i developed really bad agoraphobia ( fear of leaving the house ) - i literally couldn ' t go outside to check the mail . i ' d make excuses not to even go to the grocery store - i ' d make my girlfriend buy all our groceries , which only made her hate me more . i hated my life , and i hated *myself* even more . i had no friends , no confidence , no reason for existing , nothing that made me smile . my family lived 5000km away so i didn ' t even have them . i was obviously depressed as hell about it all - like i said , i used to fantasise about the knives in the kitchen draw , or i ' d be crossing the road and i ' d see a truck coming and i ' d think , "" if i just closed my eyes and stood here right now , it could all be over . "" worst of all i was completely hopeless - i was convinced there was **no way** i could ever change . i was stuck in this miserable existence and i ' d always be unhappy . i told myself when i hit my 30th birthday , i was allowed to kill myself . eventually i hit rock bottom when my girlfriend broke up with me , and my family found out how depressed/suicidal i ' d been . i had to confess everything - the addictions , the alcoholism , the agoraphobia , the suicidal thoughts , how much i hated living . my parents were so fucking supportive - i moved back home to live with them for a year . they forced me to go see a counsellor , and forced me to start leaving the house . it was absolute *hell* at first , but i slowly got better at just being outside , then making friends , then working on my addictions . i lost weight ( 75lbs in total ) , started hitting the gym and lifting weights ( went from not being able to do a single pushup/pullup/squat , to being able to deadlift 175kg ) . i found self-improvement websites and started getting my mind right , worked on actually *liking* myself , and started building a life i could be proud of . the last thing i had to fix was my dating life - and that was honestly the hardest thing ever . i went through an "" approach anxiety program "" ( google "" good looking loser approach anxiety program "" - it ' s free ) and that was absolute hell . you end up talking to 1500+ girls over the 6 weeks . but , by the end of it , i was confident enough to actually hit on girls properly and try to have sex with them ( even though i was still terrified and shaking most of the time ) , and i actually started getting laid . i went on okcupid/pof/tinder/etc as well , and over time got really good at getting laid on there too . i ' ve met some fucking *amazing* women over the years since then , including my current girlfriend of 2 years . she ' s the sweetest , coolest girl i ' ve met - she adds a *hell* of a lot to my life . she ' s also bisexual so we ' ve had a bunch of 3somes with other girls ( about 12 from memory ) . good fun . i never in a billion years thought i ' d actually have any women truly *like* me for who i am - let alone have sex with me - let alone have 3somes and wild sex adventures a girlfriend who adores me . that stuff seemed so impossibly out-of-reach for me all those years ago; like a pipe dream i dare not even contemplate . most importantly of all , i ' m really fucking **happy** with my life . i haven ' t had a suicidal thought in years , i haven ' t been depressed in years - every fucking day feels like i ' ve been given a gift and i ' m so bloody grateful for it . i cover the rest of my transformation story here : [my transformation . ] ( <url> ) some before/after pics : & # x200b; <url> & # x200b; <url> & # x200b; <url> & # x200b; <url> & # x200b; and [proof i get laid now] ( <url> ) ( including pics/vids/stories ) . i hate the idea that anyone is sitting on here thinking they ' re a *lost cause* , that it ' s too late for them , that they ' re too far gone , that they ' ll never be able to change . i hate the idea anyone feels like their struggles are insurmountable . trust me when i say this : **i am nothing special** . it doesn ' t take willpower ( in fact , i have [very little discipline or willpower] ( <url> ) ) . you just have to start working on your goals a little at a time - aim to just take *one tiny little baby step forward* every single day . those tiny little steps add up over time , and before you know it , you ' ll be a long way ahead of where you started . if you ' re unhappy with your appearance - start losing fat/hit the gym . all you have to do is sign up for a gym membership , or go google "" how to lose weight "" . **that ' s one baby step you can take right now . ** if you don ' t know how to talk to girls , go google "" good looking loser approach anxiety program "" . just google it and read a bit of it . **that ' s one baby step you can take right now . ** if you have no idea where to meet women , sign up for tinder and just start talking to girls . i have a huge ( free ) tinder guide on my site that covers literally every step from improving your looks , to taking pics , to messaging girls , going on dates , having sex , and even keeping them around for months/years afterwards . seriously , just install tinder and just start getting used to how the app works ( you don ' t even have to message any girls yet ) - **that ' s one baby step you can take right now . ** if you ' re super depressed , google counsellors in your area . or send a message to a mate , "" hey man i gotta be honest , i ' ve been feeling really bad lately .

gh1ijl,"a man ' s worst enemydiscussed in greater detail on my [daily video . ] ( <url> ) there lurks an enemy in the soul of every man . so insidious is the enemy that many cannot even see it or know it . it is the difference between a rich man and a poor man . a ceo and an underling . a ' has ' and a ' has not ' . someone who learns from those who have paved a successful path and someone who complains that they can ' t be successful and gives excuses . that enemy of man is instant gratification . **examples include : ** \-eating a sugary treat when you know you should eat healthy \-hitting the snooze button instead of jumping out of bed and working out \-going out with friends instead of studying finishing that project or studying for that exam \-taking out a high interest loan and eventually shelling out way more money for it instead of saving for it and paying with cash \-playing video games instead of building out a business or brand or any other passion that could actually make you money \-looking at porn and shooting your mojo into a tissue instead of letting it build up and guiding you into starting new relationships in the end , all of these things come down to you being addicted to dopamine . your body will supply you with dopamine when you do any of the above and there are many more examples than what i just listed . so what is the answer to fighting this ? well that should be obvious . the ally in this fight is delayed gratification . but how do we get in contact with this ally ? you can throw away your video games and your drugs if you need to . it ' s an extreme method of control , but if you are constantly succumbing to instant gratification it is something to consider . one of my favorite ways to do that is this : get in touch with your ' future-self ' and ask yourself now what you wish you had done as your ' past-self . ' for example . . . where do you want to be in 20 years ? perhaps a nice house on some big land . 3 cars . maybe some kids . maybe not . but do you really want to be living in your parents basement or with roommates ? what is your 50 year old self going to say to your 25 year old self ? let me tell you this . . . as a 34 year old man i curse my 21 year old self . i had ample opportunity to be in the military . . to study hard . . to lift weights earlier . . to be much more successful earlier on . but no , i pissed my early and mid 20s away with video games , marijuana and porn . yes i still bedded women but for what ? my success today is largely based on choices i made in my 30s . my 50 year old self has desires and i cannot let that future man down . do not let your future-self down ! **lessons learned : ** all the choices we make today shape our future . if you can truly delay gratification you are setting your self up for a much brighter and successful life . if you are constantly giving into your desires for a quick dopamine hit your future will be less than it could have been .",0,train

gi4im0,"is it just me or is it time to normalise non-invasive vasectomies the way we do iuds ? # ittakestwobefore anyone gets defensive , lets break this down . non-invasive vasectomies are . . . non-invasive . theyre an outpatient procedure and after reading a lot about it , theyre compared to dental procedures that you can drive home from , and the worst part is the pain of anaesthetics . the only issue seems to be that vasectomies are harder ( and completely possible ) to reverse , and that insurance doesnt cover reversal ( but they do cover vasectomies ) . now lets discuss iuds . in a lot of countries , people who havent given birth aret considered for iud procedures and some countries administer local anaesthesia . im not mentioning it because i agree , but because of the implications of severity . most women are given ibuprofen , which doesnt do much considering you have to push past the cervix opening ( that is closed tight ) with a rod to insert an iud . for those who are having a hard time imagining , think about a hard rod being shoved up your urethra . as for side effects , where do i even begin ? constant bleeding for 1-6 months after the insertion ? weight gain ? acne ? fever and debilitating cramps after insertion ? severe pms mood swings that border on clinical depression ? life threatening ( ectopic ) pregnancy ? irregular/heavy bleeding until its taken out ? increase risked of infections ? perforation ( piercing through the uterus wall ) ? extreme cramping with a copper ( non-hormonal ) iud ? i am sick and tired , and frankly , disgusted , by the pressures put on women to be the ones responsible for birth control when it takes two to reproduce . and for the people who think : not my body , not my problem , you think paying for an abortion or child support is a risk not worth taking ? birth control comes with awful side effects , and do you know how stressful it is to take a pill at the same time everyday ? do you know what its like to make plans always having to consider that ? compared to a one-time non-invasive , outpatient procedure that has the highest rates of preventing pregnancy ? i see high school and college students taking responsibility and getting iud insertions . its about time we start calling out absurd double standards and placing responsibility on all participating parties . dear women , dont feel discouraged . im iffy about talking to my male friends about this but what seems to separate the boys from the men is that while boys remain self-centred and self-involved , men understand my stance and even begin to agree with it . i want to reiterate , im not here to divide genders and pit them amongst themselves . im here to spread awareness and to hold people accountable instead of babying them . # ittakestwo [edit : i dont know if vasectomies are a viable solution . but . . . i would like to point out the discrepancy in the way we discuss what men might have to endure and what women have repeatedly endured . if theres such a huge burden on women , isnt it worth it to discuss and explore a variety of solutions no matter how bizarre they might seem before shutting it down completely ? are womens burdens that insignificant that we immediately shut down something that seems scary but may or may not be scary in actuality ? that insignificant that we shut down solutions because the idea of it causes discomfort ? that insignificant that possible pain takes priority of actual pain ? ]",0,test

fr14hbp,"you are never going to get the reassurance of the subjective experience of others . i ' m married and i ' ve been with my partner for a decade . is he with me because i make incredible lasagna ? because he loves me in a cosmic , unchangeable way ? because he wants me in a lustful way ? because i was convenient ? well , yes . all of that , at times , and probably more reasons . i honestly have no idea most of the time . a decade-long thing doesn ' t last on lust alone . so it ' s a bit of everything , i ' m guessing , but i really have no way of measuring his subjective experience of me . so , for my peace of mind , i don ' t really try to do that . i am not , inherently , interested in how his brain engages with his choice to be married to me , it ' s just not that important . i can ' t know it , it wouldn ' t change anything material about my experiences with him , and it really is none of my business anyway . other people ' s experience of me isn ' t my business . all i can control , all i have power over , is how i am treated and what kinds of experiences i want in my life . that ' s it . i can solicit behaviors , i can reject behaviors , but ultimately that ' s all i can sway . my husband treats me like he loves me in a cosmic way . he treats me like he wants me sexually . he treats me like i make great lasagna . and sometimes he treats me like a fixture in his life he doesn ' t have to question and can just rely on automatically , which i appreciate since i do it too . his behavior matches with my internal set of expectations for how someone who loves me would behave , and he says he loves me , so that ' s good enough . i don ' t really need to interrogate if what i think about as love and what he thinks of as love are identical experiences or motivated for the right reasons . the experience of being loved by him *is* acceptable , so that ' s good enough . all anyone can do is tell you and show you their truth . if they tell you they want you and they show you they want you , that ' s as much as you ' ll ever get . if they tell you they respect you and they treat you respectfully , that ' s all you ' ll ever get . all you can do is set expectations about what level of commitment , love , and respect is required for you to be intimate with someone and go from there . you get to set your expectations for how you want to be treated and people can meet them or not . you further decide to put up with it or not . for now , in human history , you ' re never going to get to look behind the curtain and see someone ' s real motivations , to experience their reasoning and desire , to get capital ' t ' truth on how they feel about you . self-esteem is a real kick in the teeth on this one . it is the force that informs you when you ' re being tolerated as opposed to cherished . it ' s what tells you that your subjective experience of your beauty is the only thing that matters , that evidence of someone ' s lust must be a lie . if you hate yourself , you ' ll never believe that the words and behaviors you ' re experiencing are truthful because , how could they be ? and , really , no one will ever be able to tell you differently because that ' s the entire toolbox at their disposal . but that ' s not their failing to impart their truth , that ' s your inability to read it and accept it . as a result , a lot of people only accept people with nasty , cruel behaviors and words because that feels more real , somehow , or at least offers up something believable . swing a dead cat and you ' ll probably hit someone willing to treat you badly and confirm your bad self-assessment . so , yeah , in the most obnoxious way possible , a lot of this comes down to fixing your own internal metrics for the expectations you set , the behaviors you ' ll tolerate , the evidence you ' ll find convincing . which just . . . sucks . because that ' s hard , painful work that takes a long time to internalize . but doing it makes everything so , so much nicer .",0,train

"" the idea ain ' t to send some fancy-ass message or anything . just trying to test the waters to see if she ' ll even bother to answer to that . if she does , great ! you can try again where you stopped before . if she doesn ' t , it ' s unlikely she would have been interested anyway and you can move on without having to wonder if you should try again ! easier to do when you ' re having some success with other girls in the meantime and are outcome independent with this specific one .",0,train
fqe3kmk,that is a very generic boring message . i agree though that you can always try . when it comes to texting i always go by : never be boring especially when initiating a conversation .,0,train
fqdeg2y,"i think it ' s important to give the girl enough space to re-initiate the conversation without letting your rapport die completely . what that looks like in practice , hard to say . if she stops replying i would definitely give her a couple of days to reach out , though . i think it ' s also important to note that girls are in different states at different times . if she ' s feeling social and wants to meet people at the particular time you ' re talking to her then she ' s likely to be more responsive than if you catch her at a time when she ' s worn down and wants to chill for a couple of weeks . half the battle is catching her at a time when she ' s dtf .",0,train
fqdjayj,"the hell yes hell no principle is just meant to make a better use of your time . the idea being why chasing a girl who has low interest when million others are potentially ready to jump on your d without any effort . however i concur that you shouldn ' t necessarily give up at the first sign of resistance . if she pulls away and back off from a date , shrug it off , put a 2 or 3 months timer on and wait for her to either contact you or the end of the timer where you can send a feeler text to see what she is up to . still not available for date ? no problem , reset the timer again if you keep repeating the process and that she had some interest initially it ' s very likely , you ' ll end up hooking up at some point",0,train

fqdwqir,"my most recent girlfriend was like this , she just kept curving and curving , but you really have to play with your gut , some girls its pretty obvious shes just playing games , but with her , it was clear that she was just fresh out of a relationship , and scared of men , essentially . if a girl seems interested when you text her , but then leaves you on read after a while , understand that its either this , or in all likelihood , you arent the only guy she is talking to . ( shocker , i know . ) i dont typically entertain girls who send one word replies , and then leave me on read after a while , in fact , im usually the one who leaves the girl on read at this point , but if she is generally engaging , might be worth playing the long game . the best advice i can give though , dont double text on the same day , thats a mistake i made for a long time , and it was impulsive . it also helps to have them on multiple platforms , my last girlfriend for example , i finally got a first date with her through the instagram dms , and the rest is history .",0,train

gk254m,"on the perception that feminism blames men for everything . this is a common sticking point and a common criticism of feminism coming from mra-aligned people . here is my best attempt to summarize the issue : most feminists seem to believe that patriarchy and misogyny are the only valid lens through which to look at mens issues . the ideas of anti-male sexism and misandry are a taboo in feminism . any double standards that seem to negatively affect men are rationalized as misogyny backfiring . if you talk about an issue where men get the short end of the stick ( such as bias in child custody proceedings ) , feminists are quick to point out that , in fact , patriarchy is responsible for this . if you talk about how men are shamed for showing emotions ( by both men and women ) , feminists are quick to point out that this is a result of misogyny that showing emotion is considered feminine and thus inferior . therefore the blame falls on patriarchy again . to a non-feminist , this leads to the impression that feminists are blaming men ( as a class ) for all gender-based unfairness . in fact , the eagerness with which feminists blame patriarchy suggests that they think its very important that everyone understands exactly where the blame should lie ( on men ) . feminists , do you agree with the perception that you blame men , as a class , for most ( or all ) gender-based unfairness ? do you think that its important to acknowledge that the blame lies on men ? where do you think the balance falls between class-based and individual repsonsibility ? is it possible for feminists and progressive mra ' s to reconcile this difference of opinion ?",0,train
fqomo3p,"i feel like the way people on this subreddit define feminism requires me to not identify as a feminist while on this subreddit . i agree that there are a lot of feminists whose views are very shallow and kinda selfish . i don ' t really participate in mainstream feminist spaces or whatever , so i might be out of touch , idk . but i don ' t blame people who think that a lot of feminists are mean to men . i ' m not smart or a social scientist , i don ' t read books by feminists or follow feminist twitter accounts , so don ' t ask me to defend this or that feminist figure . but i think that patriarchy isn ' t really men ' s fault . it ' s the fault of conservatism , maybe . gender roles exist for a reason , but they ' re outdated now . the people who keep clinging to them and enforcing them unnecessarily include men and women , so it ' s not a men problem .",0,train
fqonspj,"this is a good question op . . . i hope we can get some feminists perspectives on addressing this , as there are feminists who do not think like this ( sadly they are not the ones in power ) . let me show a case in point : so what you said has real effects and is not just theory . for example feminists blocking the only ever male welfare officer at university in the entire uk . making a campaign against him so he stepped down and it never went ahead : >olivia bailey , nus national women ' s officer , said : "" discrimination against men on the basis of gender is so unusual as to be non-existent , so what exactly will a men ' s society do ? "" "" to suggest that men need a specific space to be ' men ' is ludicrous , when everywhere you turn you will find male-dominated spaces , "" she added . i mean just one rebuttal to that is men are a minority in university . in education an example of flat out sexism and institutional sexism at an international scale ( which she denies is ) : >throughout the oecd teachers mark girls higher for identical work to boys . furthermore , a boy will receive 1/3 higher grade in reading tests if the teacher does not know he is a boy ( oecd ) from teachers give girls higher grades despite boys objectively getting higher test scores source : [<url>] ( <url> ) someone with some sense : >as sarah mcculloch , the female treasurer of the mens society at manchester puts it : "" it ' s important that everyone be included in the discussion about how to create a more equal and fair society , and i don ' t believe t**hat we will achieve true equality by allowing men to tag along with the women ' s liberation movement men have their own problems . "" ** so i have learned some feminists are critical of modern feminism and do actually not like this idea of unidirectional power dynamics with men being oppressors and women being victims and patriachy being responsible for womens individual actions ( and mens ) . . . this type of feminism needs to raise up and be the loudest voice because at the moment feminism has gone mad . i mean decreeing air conditioning is sexist , sleep is sexist etc .",0,train

"" file sharing programs were popular for downloading mp3s but they were also gigantic repositories for adult material . you could type in a search string and click download all . a few hours later you ' d have tons and tons of video material . then the streaming sites came and we have today ' s version of modern porn access . i realize many of you might not have a problem with porn . i myself have been able to suppress my use of it . but we are here to help other men . a lot of the guys that read this site are young and might be struggling with this . i used to struggle before i knew i was struggling with it . at this point i believe porn is a weapon being used to subdue the desires and passions of millions of men around the world . think about it . there is a reason why russia and china both have laws banning the production of it . these are our rivals . . . and they must be laughing knowing americans and westerners are mostly subdued by this degeneracy . blowing their loads into tissues and draining themselves of their testosterone on a nightly basis . as someone who has used porn while in an ltr and then stopped using it there is a big difference in sexual pleasure once you abstain . death grip is real and makes real sex less pleasurable . once you beat death grip sex will feel like losing your virginity every time . if you ' re not whacking it often you won ' t be suffering from death grip but it is real for those whacking it on a nightly basis . and for those who think approaching women is not worth it . . . that ' s likely your opinion because you have an outlet for your desires . take that outlet away and your sexual drive will take off like a rocket ship and you will inevitably become good at cold-approach because you will have no other choice . there is no shame in admitting you might have a problem and there are tools that can help . porn blocking tools exist and work in multiple ways . of course they can ' t stop you on every single device you own so you ' ll need some discipline . the nofap community on this website and other places is also very helpful for support and questions . other men will literally jump in a cold shower in the first few days of abstaining if they must . there is no shame if you have been a victim of this . again , not all of you will be in this position . you might be enjoying a good porn-laced whack every now and then and that ' s fine . and some of you might already know that you can whack it without porn entirely and its much healthier for you . i ' m definitely not advocating for pure nofap forever . just don ' t let it get out of control . build your power and testosterone by keeping it in your balls for a week or so before release if you ' re by yourself . and remember , dating use app is on the rise even on lock-down . women are horny and alone and want a man to get in bed with them regardless of the local rules of social-distance in place . lessons learned : \-my opinion on porn is that it is a tool used by rival governments to hurt the men of the west . \-death grip is real and comes from nightly porn use . it will prevent you from feeling maximum pleasure when having sex . \-daily use of porn is hurting your motivation to speak to women and form relationships . \-tools exist to prevent or curb porn use and there are other methods you can do to help in the form of distracting yourself . & # x200b; sources : porn laws by country -- <url> porn blockers -- <url> tinder use is way up ! -- <url>",1,train

fr12m9t,">at this point i believe porn is a weapon being used to subdue the desires and passions of millions of men around the world . think about it . there is a reason why russia and china both have laws banning the production of it . they ban production of it because their society is based more so around judaeo-christian values and they dont promote for personal freedom . they also censor any website or article that says something bad about the government >blowing their loads into tissues and draining themselves of their testosterone on a nightly basis . ( if your being hyperbolic my bad for taking it seriously ) fapping has no significant effect on testosterone , every study that depicts a change in testosterone all show the same result , testosterone goes up on day 7 of abstinence then goes back to normal on day 8 . and having real sex had the same effect on testosterone",0,train

fqhscq6,"wow , this was actually a really helpful read . particularly for work and going out with friends scenarios . funny how i often find the need to apologize for some of these things , but when other people do it i instinctively find it a sign of weakness or feel unnecessarily sorry for them .",0,train
fqi5adj,"overall a decent list , but it ' s typed in a vacuum and not reality . a couple of thoughts as i read through this : you can apologize for your appearance if you know you look like a schlub . if you were invited to a dinner , and you thought it was only a 6/10 formal thing , and it turned out being an 8/10 formal thing , it ' s okay to apologize for being slightly underdressed . it could even be what starts a good conversation , although i wouldn ' t start with it . and you should apologize for expressing your emotions if the way you express them is harsh or hurtful to those you ' re expressing them too . i feel like the way this part was written can be interpreted into it being okay to go off on someone or something . no one ever says what they feel about something every time they feel it , the very second they feel it . things always get bottled up to a degree . the listicle should mention that not being 100% forthright in your emotions is only natural , and that this is not carte blanche approval to erupt unapologetically . you could conceivably apologize if you ' re reaching out too often for help . it means you ' re aware of the other person ' s time . idk . i just think that we shouldn ' t be afraid to apologize , instead of looking for every justification not to do so . especially under the guise that it makes you look weak , when apologizing ( maybe not *for* something , but *that it happened* ) can make you more sincere , trustworthy , and considerate . i mean , the rest of the list is good , and even those things i called out , i get where the author is coming from . but people notice when nothing is ever your fault . and it ' s a major red flag .",0,test
fqifvom,"first of all thanks for the feedback , and i am not saying that apologizing is a bad thing . this list mentions all the points that don ' t require a sorry in general . if you feel sorry or regret doing anything wrong then it is very obvious that you must have done something wrong , in that case , you should apologize for it . i don ' t want to stretch it much , but i really liked your ideology .",0,test

gjmfvs,"red pill rage makes you look petty . **introduction** i recently had a young man send me a text saying how he is mad at the world , how women are a waste of time , f this f that . he lost his cool . as someone who is older than him and as someone he looks up to , i feel like i am personally responsible for not handling this . so i sat him down for a talk , to explain what he is going through . red pill rage . **body** this is a phase that many men go through after realizing how this world operates . we were once blue pilled simps who were shown the light ( or found it/were driven to it ) . we are now in recovery mode to become who we were biologically born to be . this is a life long process , its slow , but if you are consistent , it will be steady up and up . it ' s the school of life . you will study , pass , and fail . its normal . someone going through red pill rage will exhibit symptoms including but not limited to : * anger and disdain for women * anger and disdain for the people who raised him * depression and lack of motivation to proceed in the world * confusion as to what to do next . the sidebar covers pretty much all the fundamentals that we must go out and practice through execution , but it is not a play by play . it is not a step by step instruction manual on what to do , and this is what frustrates people going through rage even more . and the younger and less based the person is , the worse and chaotic his rage will be . let me explain why . the blue pilled betas can actually teach us something . their life ' s goal is to succeed in this world . have a "" stable "" career , have "" retirement "" savings , have a "" normal "" family , raise "" normal "" kids , etc . they want that blue pilled life dream , even if they have to work their ass off for it . they are willing ( even if brainwashed ) into giving up their lives to build this "" stable "" world around them . sure there are always exceptions to this rule , but at least the more traditional men , will be chasing a stable career in medicine or engineering or something . this makes them at least well based in their own life . even if they go through a divorce and realize how blue pilled they are , red pill rage will last a shorter amount of time for them , because they already have a financial and educational foundation . they have a resume , they just have to start their social/sexual life over , which , thanks to the sidebar , is as simple as going out into the real world and fucking up repeatedly until you get the hang of it ( not really but you get the gist ) . a young man in his late teens or early college years who finds the red pill , and realizes why his young sexual life is absolute garbage , will have severe rage . this is because he has no existing foundation . he hasn ' t had a marriage/relationship that is long enough to give him some experience . he doesn ' t have the finances to be able to just move to a new city and start over . he doesn ' t have a "" successful "" resume . he goes into full panic mode , and eventually , just gives up . he knows he needs to get his shit together , but on top of his obligations to get his financial and practical life together , he is now bombarded with information on how to fix his still not fully developed sexual life . again , there are plenty of exceptions to the rules . i have seen young men who found the red pill and immediately saw the mountain they must climb and proceeded to hatch multiple plans on how to do so . others . . . fell into depression cursing the world they live in and becoming more reliant on spoon fed step by step instructions on how to proceed . this dependence on a play by play must be broken . so here i will leave some recommendations as to what to do if you find yourself in this situation . this is not a step by step instruction booklet . these are tips that will explain what you are feeling , why , and where to go . 1 . you are mad at women for being the way they are . okay , and ? screw them . focus on yourself and your individual happiness and satisfaction ( in moderation ) as well as making sure you have a solid foundation financially and educationally . 2 . "" everything we do is just to get laid , what is the point ? ! "" this is where you need to change your mindset . getting laid is a perk of having a solid foundation as a man . be a man first , slay pussy later . you need to understand that you do not revolve around women , they revolve around you . you must become a magnet , not be attracted to one . a magnet has scientific properties that make it attract all sorts of metals . irl this is : money , fame , good looks , reputation , success , status , masculine alpha behavior/mentality , an idgaf mentality for sure . magnets do not fucking care what you are , if you ' re within range , you will be attracted . 3 . you feel like you know more than the men around you so now you are acting petty and posting on your instagram story about how "" women suck and man up and etc "" . stop . just stop . you are just like everyone else , we are just like you . we are all in the same boat , you are not special , and just because you know something someone else doesn ' t , doesn ' t mean you are better . also , stop putting red pill stuff you read online on your instabooks , you will alienate anyone who sees it . just get off social media period , stop texting women and being their little bitch , go to # 1 on this list , go make your base . no not a pillow fort . a base , somewhere you live , somewhere you can go to when shit hits the fan and start over . **conclusion** remember at least one thing from all of this : this is not an over night change . this will take years . just like the gym wont turn you into the rock over night , reading trp content and practicing it wont make you an alpha over night . i know i am far from where i want to be , but i want to try , and i will try . so go cool off from the rage , accept the world as it is , and learn to use it to your advantage .",1,train

"" **despite the social isolation** and the raise of friendlessness , there is one aspect of life that can never be satisfied without physical contact : sex . people have become less likely to go out to make friends , but more likely to go out to get laid . the impulse to have sex still drives people to talk to strangers and younger generations have become more open about casual sex and approaching strangers with the clear intent of fucking . as a result of this , if you get approached by a stranger in public , the chances of them wanting to be your friend are lower than ever before in history and at the same time the chances of them wanting to bang you are highest than ever before . **change my view** : people assume the worst of any interaction because wanting to make friends has become less common than ever but openly wanting to fuck has become more common than ever .",0,train

gi75i0,"own your shit weekly - may 12 , 2020a fundamental core principle here is that you are the judge of yourself . this means that you have to be a very tough judge , look at those areas you never want to look at , understand your weaknesses , accept them , and then plan to overcome them . bravery is facing these challenges , and overcoming the challenges is the source of your strength . we have to do this evaluation all the time to improve as men . in this thread we welcome everyone to disclose a weakness they have discovered about themselves that they are working on . the idea is similar to some of the activities in no more mr . nice guy . you are responsible for identifying your weakness or mistakes , and even better , start brainstorming about how to become stronger . mistakes are the most powerful teachers , but only if we listen to them . think of this as a boxing gym . if you found out in your last fight your legs were stiff , we encourage you to admit this is why you lost , and come back to the gym decided to train more to improve that . at the gym the others might suggest some drills to get your legs a bit looser or just give you a pat in the back . it does not matter that you lost the fight , what matters is that you are taking steps to become stronger . however , dont call the gym saying hey , someone threw a jab at me , what do i do now ? . we discourage reddit puppet play-by-play advice . also , **don ' t blame others for your shit . ** this thread is about you finding how to work on yourself more to achieve your goals by becoming stronger . finally , a good way to reframe the shit to feel more motivated to overcome your shit is that after you explain it , rephrase it saying how you will take concrete measurable actions to conquer it . the difference between complaining about bad things , and committing to a concrete plan to overcome them is the difference between beta and alpha . gentlemen , own your shit .",0,train

*of course they desire me - because i have high value as a red pilled man who owns his shit - this one is lucky i ' m deciding to gift her with my time and attention* , it is extremely easy to be on the wrong side of that line , or lie to yourself about which side of it you ' re on ) i won ' t blame anyone but myself if shit hits the fan because of my choices . i ' ve made some progress already , but not the full on critical leaps that are necessary to never need this kind of external proof again . i had the internal realization that women ' s value of me isn ' t a worthy measurement of my value , not even this small part of my value , nor is it an accurate one . this is why it is so important to be my own judge in all things . my mental state has quickly arrived at the fact that plating women can ' t be a mission , not even a side mission , its basically a distraction at best - a "" hobby of interest "" to pass time enjoyably and help one relax after a day spent living a fulfilling life . women ( single women especially ) are all desperate to connect to a man who doesn ' t enervate them , and offers escape from their shitty , lonely existence . awalt . j10 and u/hornsofapathy put it well , and as i ' ve been going on dates with these women over the last month while mostly larping alfa , the truth of that is crystal clear . the better i embodied that energizing hvm who could offer "" the great escape "" , the better my dates went . having an attitude and outlook absolutely overflowing with positivity and life energy ( "" abundance "" ) was extremely attractive to them , whether in a high or low energy environment . i ' m not that guy yet , but i ' m not exactly larping him either . he ' s in me , got buried alive for a while , and i just have to keep helping him grow to become an automatic part of who i am . j10 talked about a hot tub soak . one of my plates has a nice deep tub in her room connected to a standing shower ( hers is the master in the house ) , so after we fucked this last time , i spontaneously had the desire to try it out . as a reward for her , i let her join me for the bubble hot soak . i had her sitting in my lap in the tub , both of us laid back , just relaxing and talking and joking about nothing important . she commented that she "" didn ' t think it would be this nice "" just to take a bath together . the time i spent at her place was less than 3 hours total , yet that *escape* was there , and was tied to having great sex with me . she was asking before i left if i could stay over , and when she could see me again . the next time she started the bath herself and asked me in . this is like a different kind of dynamite , and i need to treat it with the same care . i hadn ' t reread hoa ' s and j10 ' s words prior to reflecting on this week in at least 4 months , and everything i ' ve been doing with this chick and the other 2 has been almost 100% on instinct , very little thinking , so something somewhere must be clicking . . . the experiences i ' ve had reminded me of their words . good to reread them and remember what i ' m working towards as a starting point for an eventual ltr if one of them vets properly , although not likely . fuck me . . . just reread the other parts of hoa ' s "" great escape "" and a staple of what i ' ve been telling my plates from the very beginning is that i don ' t judge them , i only judge myself .

fqd16lo,"**oys # 34** lockdown ending this week week 9 stats : 40 yo , height 186 cm , weight 85 kg , bodyfat 16% navy method , wife 39 yo , living together for 13 years , married for 8 . kids are 3 ( girl ) and 6 ( boy ) . home workout stats : q&d protocol by pavel tsatsouline , usually with a 20kg kettlebell 3 times per week . this week was pussy week , however . **readings : ** sidebar books read : mmslp , nmmngx2 , wisnifg , rm , twotsm , map , saving a low sex marriage , bigger leaner stronger , pook . books read that are not on the sidebar : bigger leaner stronger , leangains , kettlebell simple and sinister , the quick and the dead now reading : fuccfiles , sgm reading queue : day bang , 48lop **shit to own** *health : * in his books pavel tsatsouline calls the 48kg kettlebell the beast . in keeping with the tradition , i will call the 12 kilo bell the pussy . long story short , i injured my back and switched to the pussy for this weeks workouts . it happened after waiting in line for a long time with shitty posture reading sgm on my phone . bad kb swing form could be a contributing factor , or it could be the extreme back flexion required until recently to put my daughter to bed . constant 4-5 level pain in the very low back near the hips , on the right-hand side , with the occasional flashes of 8-9 when i tried to bend over or get up from bed . lasted for 2 days and then subsided but did not completely go away . for two days , putting on socks or tying my shoes was a challenge . i pulled out kettlebell simple and sinister , the chapter on hip hinge and proper form with the swing and did all the exercises with the pussy two-handed . yesterday did the same , with the 20kg kettlebell . back felt fine . i decompress the spine by hanging from a bar at least once per day , i do hamstring stretches and try to avoid flexion of the spine as much as possible . i might even go to the doctor as an extreme measure , if all else fails . gyms will maybe open later this week . if so , i will do the first barbell workout this weekend and keep it light . key takeaway : im dealing with the back pain without being a miserable whining pussy , esp . with the wife . *relationship ( contains action item from last week ) : * so i play this game where i initiate at least two times per week and i win if my initiation was good according to me . actually , its according to my dick if it gets hard , the initiation was good . i continue to watch out for diminutive words and im being successful like 80% of the time . by above mentioned measure i did one low quality initiation and one high quality , both did not result in sex because the wife was tired or something . but the sexual pressure got to her so during the say she started giving me iois and coming to me for a kiss and an ass grab and eventually initiated sex herself . it was exactly like my standard nice guy initiations , only with the roles reversed : i asked her for a back rub because my back was sore , she gave me a good enough back rub and then started escalating with kisses all over my back and shoulders , getting naked and grinding her pussy on my ass and hips . i threw her down , ate her out , did a quick 69 where she licked my balls and then fucked missionary . barely managed to last long enough and she came several seconds after me , which means i had to pump away with the post-cum erection . p . s . sex makes the back pain worse . i had so much fun eliminating dimunitive words , i am going start another game speak slowly , with a strong tone , eliminate verbal bullshit . key takeaway # 1 : at some point i switched from seeking validation from my wife to seeking validation from random internet faggots . takeaway # 2 : i need to improve my immersion first before focusing on the d , e , or v . also , jerk off more often so that i can last longer . *work ( action item from last week ) : * this week my company returns to the office full time . i stay till late in the office and focus on clearing the to do list . *kids : * i am doing a better job of setting boundaries before i lose my shit . i am also keeping cool when my wife loses her shit over the kids misbehaving . she has a much lower threshold than me . the son wanted me to buy him a new game to play on his android . its a gigantic sum of money , around 10 euros . i wanted to buy it and use it as a reward for some desired behavior . i decided it should not be something he is supposed to be doing anyway , so i think i found the perfect solution : the son now has to demonstrate to me and the wife how he plays the free version of the game and stops playing when we tell him to stop . i told him in order to buy you a good video game i want to see that you are able to control your addiction . we use the words phone sickness with him . *thoughts on sgm : * the # 1 thing ill remember from sgm it the notion that women need sex more than men . it may or may not be true , but its a great frame to adopt when dealing with the wife , as in : i am giving her the gift of fucking . **goals till may 19th next week** new : eliminate verbal bullshit , speak slowly and deliberately get back to 15% bf or below <-- getting there own the 20kg kettlebell 100 reps one-handed in 5 minutes <-- fuck , not gonna happen keep initiating and dngf <-- going ok so far start one of the game books ( day bang ? ) and try out stuff on the wife <-- might have to postpone the deadline **mission/ long-term stuff** stop giving a fuck what others think , switch to internal validation become a high energy charismatic guy . prioritize my career and be successful in my current role , which is essentially running a business within the company help my kids grow confident and strong , so that they make the big life decisions driven by ambition as opposed to driven by fear",0,train

fqsvmp0,"the old school mafia/yakuza sort of organizations were killed off , because they were collectively a threat to the rising power of the organized crime syndicate that infiltrated and took over politics . singularly , a mafia family or yakuza gang was only really effective in their own burrow . they might have been a thorn in the side of a mayor or police chief . but even then , they largely kept things in-house and had somewhat of a code of "" no innocents "" or at least , no touching those within their own communities . then , as more of these organizations formed , they started getting more powerful . forming alliances , making enemies of each other . then drugs became a huge part of it , and a lot of the rules went out the window . sometime during the 60s and 70s , when the drugs were rampant within those underworld gangs , they basically were at odds with gov entities , kind of like what we see now in places like mexico where they have cartel problems . their power wasn ' t really equal , but it was enough to be a threat . where those people held as much sway or perhaps coercion over their communities as any gov entity did . it was pretty well documented that they could even sway elections , and that goes back even into the early days . if a bunch of mafia dudes showed up to collect their protection money , and "" reminded "" you that your business , and all of your employees needed to vote for a certain candidate . . . . that probably meant that if that candidate lost , there would be repercussions . so those businesses needed to coerce their employees , their unions , etc . , through whatever means , to vote a certain way . well . . . . once they become at odds with the politicians as a whole , they have lose their usefulness in that regard , which is why they basically went extinct . i mean , sure . . . there are still shady organized crime rings , but it ' s mostly cartel linked stuff now . nothing like the mafia/yakuza stuff from back in the day . all of that stuff more or less dissipated . they all either went to prison , died off , or went into politics . the same families , the same money , the same old power structures still exist somewhat . . . they just don ' t have the same ways of doing business . now they just operate through political business dealings , big donors , and fundraisers . the "" protection money "" rackets are less about sending thugs to a sandwich shop with baseball bats to collect money , assuring them that nobody will bust their windows out . . . but more about sending a limo with political campaign lawyers to a boardroom to assure corporate interests that votes against a certain regulation are going to go a certain way so long as the campaign gets into office . . . at which point donations are made to the campaign . really . . . . you can think about the organized crime world like an organism with life cycles . the 20th century romanticized version of mobsters running around all tony soprano was basically the coming of age , angsty teenager stage . it matured in the 90s and 2000s and morphed into the adult stage that we have now .",0,test

gl2huf,"new mother needing advice on copinghi red pill wives ! i ' m really in need of some advice in this very trying time of my life . well , i don ' t know if i need advice , a slap in the face , a shoulder to cry on , or just to commiserate - i guess i just need some context . my husband and i have been married for a year and a half and we have a 7 . 5 month old son . i ' m really struggling with the transition from purely homemaker to include being a stay-at-home-mom . my husband works a great job and we have always been in agreement that our ideal situation would have me staying at home looking after our children . i feel like i ' m currently not meeting my own expectations or my husband ' s expectations of what i should be doing at this point . the first few months were absolutely survival , we both knew that going into it , but now that we ' ve found more of a routine with the baby i ' m struggling even more now that there ' s more expectations of me . the idea that there ' s zero "" time off "" from motherhood is really eating at me in a way i hadn ' t anticipated . i end up feeling slightly resentful and come off as ungrateful to my husband when his job "" ends "" and he gets a break in the evenings . he frequently works on things at home ( he ' ll vpn onto work and check things during some evenings and on weekends ) so it ' s not that he only works during the day and lounges for the rest . however , i get up and cover anything that our son needs between bedtime ( around 7pm ) and i ' ll get up anywhere between 6-8am and look after him for his first wake-window . neither of us are morning people , so i find myself envying my husband who gets to stay in bed until 9 or 10 . partially for the sleep , but partially because he gets the opportunity to stay up late to enjoy his hobbies where i feel pressure to get to bed early so i ' m not absolutely dead for a 6am wakeup . we counter this problem once in a while by my husband taking the first wake-up . i ' ll get up and feed our son and he ' ll get up and spend an hour or two with him so i can get back to bed . this is usually a great treat but it ' s not feasible for him to do it super often and i feel a lot of guilt asking him to get up earlier on a work day or after i know he ' s been up late . a lot of things i previously enjoyed as a homemaker ( cleaning , cooking , general errands ) don ' t bring me joy in the same way now that it ' s a juggling act with a baby . even though i really enjoy making food for my husband , i get frustrated and anxious about getting groceries or meal planning and frequently ask if we can get take-out instead , which in turn makes me feel like i ' m doing a bad job . i try and stay on top of the laundry and dishes pretty well , but the overall state of our house is not something i ' m proud of . my husband is an absolutely awesome dad and he ' s so willing to be involved and help when he can around his work schedule . i honestly love being a mom too , it ' s just been really hard that i don ' t feel like i get to be anything but a mom anymore . i ' m half and half breastfeeding and pumping ( about 4x each per day ) . if the baby isn ' t up , i ' m usually hooked up to my breastpump , cooking/doing dishes , or doing laundry . i get a couple hours in the evening where i can take part in my hobbies , but by that point i ' m usually so exhausted that i crash and get to bed as soon as possible . any energy for physical intimacy with my husband is almost a distant memory at this point . anyways all of this aside i just feel like there ' s a normal amount of adjustment to being a new parent , but i feel like i ' m on the verge of just not coping whatsoever . i ' m having multiple breakdowns a month and i feel like i ' m putting a lot of extra burden on my husband . is it just going to be hard until baby is x months/years old ? i feel some added pressure since my husband is facing a possible big promotion where his workload will increase drastically and he won ' t be able to help as much as he is now . we also want more kids eventually , but i ' m barely hanging on with one as it is . my husband was speaking to an older work colleague over the phone the other day and they were discussing a conference that was moving to online . they have evening discussions and my husband said that he ' d try and be present once our baby was down for the night . the colleague was surprised that i wouldn ' t be able to handle doing that by myself and asked what i would be doing if he was having to travel and be at conferences in person . that ' s been eating at me for a little bit ever since it came up . the last couple of times my husband had to travel for work , my parents came to stay with me to help out ( we ' re in the us and they ' re in canada , so they ' ve had to cancel all pending travel for the time being ) . for those of you that have kids , do you have any tips on how to cope with the big life change ?

like katniss everdeen ? she volunteered as tribute which can be seen as her sacrificing herself for her younger sister . did you grow up with a misogynistic or abusive father ? was your father unromantic and ungentlemanlike towards your mother ? like he doesn ' t open doors for her or bring her surprise gifts ? you never saw him show tenderness to her ? or that he valued her for anything besides domestic duties ? was your mother a codependent who did so much for her husband but got no equal effort in return ? and you would hate to be like her ? even if you would never act like a codependent in a real relationship with a guy . in your fantasy there ' s a lot of co dependent traits showing in your character . her sacrificing herself for a guy she thinks will never be with her can be seen as masochistic and self defeating . she thinks she has to prove herself to this guy by saving him . she doesn ' t think she has a value outside of what she can do for someone which is what codependents believe . her motivations are not actually pure . she wants to be praised and admired . she wants control over this guy . & # x200b; by contrast do you find yourself being somewhat drawn to and yet cringing at helpless and very weak female characters like bella swan from twilight ? but you would never admit to being drawn to twilight in real life because so much of bella ' s appeal to the men who love her is because of her feminine traits . like her scent and her looks and her clumsiness which makes them hyper vigilant in protecting her placing them in the hero role which makes them feel strong and masculine . she doesn ' t have to do much to keep them interested . which you might hate and feel disgusted by . you want a guy to value you for things more than just your looks you want them to value you for being powerful and having virtuous characteristics . she doesn ' t have to save anyone . it ' s not her noble character that makes the guys go crazy . do you feel empty and conflicted about love stories like twilight ? do stories like twilight make you feel so many different and mostly negative emotions but yet you feel drawn to it ? because at the end bella got the guy without sacrificing herself for him . she didn ' t really do anything . she was just pretty and smelled good and got everything most people desire . love , children , wealth , beauty , immorality and youth . playing the conventionally masculine role means you switch the gender roles and you subconsciously might want to seem stronger than a guy because you have internalized misogyny . these fantasies are actually not unusual . men have savior fantasies or hero fantasies and no one would be mocking you if you were a man saying this . don ' t take it to heart what ignorant people think about this . the more you focus on how embarrassed you are the less you can dig deeper into understanding yourself . deep down you might feel suppressed in many ways . you should explore that .",1,test
gleq7q,"should i send my ex-boyfriends mom a thank you card ? if so , how ? would love some help from the rp ladies ! as i posted here before , i broke up with my semi-emotionally abusive ex for the final time , and im determined to make it stick . while he rarely verbally assaulted me ( sometimes would call me a bitch ) , he would constantly criticize me and tell me all the things about myself i needed to change . i made a list of everything he criticized me more than 3x about . there were 452 list items . one was touches lips to reusable water bottle , and another was wears pink coat that looks childish . he loves playing music and i do not ( my mom tried to force me a lot as a kid and it literally makes me panic ) , and he got into an argument with me for over an hour , trying to make me play piano for/with him . i offered to do ballet ( practiced for years as a kid ) or write songs to it , but it was no good for him . he threw a tantrum over it once , and locked himself in his room for an hour . i told him i was sick of him degrading my self-esteem , and to find someone who better fit his needs . if youre wondering why i spent so much time with this guy , its because i have low self-esteem , and because it got especially bad over the last six months . in addition , my little brother developed schizophrenia in october , and he was even more critical of me about stupid things , and it was made worse because , rather than take or accept it , i would get really mad at him and sometimes criticize him back ( which i never ever did before . ) i know thats not rpw , but it would be things like this : in december , as my little brother got sicker and no medication helped , i began the grieving process . i was crying all the time . he offered to fill up a bath . sounds nice , right ? well , i accidentally drained it and didnt notice because i was crying over my little brother losing his future ( which had looked so bright ) , and he came up to yell at me and put me down for that . i ended up breaking down crying . so . not a good relationship . learned many things and am working on my self-esteem before i get into a new one , otherwise ill just end up with the same kind of bad captain . i got home today and found two cards with gifts from his sister and mom . i knew they would send graduation gifts , so i bought each of them a $25 gift card to a coffee shop and a store they like , respectively , and sent it to them as a sweet gift . i had hoped that would be taken as a thank-you , but because they were so close to mothers day , im not sure . should i send them a thank you note ? i want to be no contact with the guy , im so serious about ending it , but i dont want to be rude . if so , how do i do it ? more background : the mom and i had a close relationship ( she was really excited about me getting married/becoming a mom and that i was with him ) , while the sister was more like him ( shes a great wife and mother , but is not very friendly/personable . she and him would sometimes put my down together . )",1,test
fqujhe0,">please keep in mind that just because you view someone as a normie or a becky or whatever does not mean that other people do or that the person you are referring to even thinks they are . thinking you ' re ugly is vastly different from actually being ugly . it doesn ' t matter that they may perceive themselves as ugly , we do not share the same experiences and they have no right to infiltrate one of the few spaces genuinely ugly people have . ugly women in real life have no voice . normies are committed to ensuring that we don ' t have a voice online either by stealing spaces meant for us , then having the audacity to expect us to have sympathy for them because : ( they ' re insecure : ( . they should not be here and it ' s not my responsibility to coddle normal or attractive people with low self-esteem .",1,train
fr2hiqm,"yes . i mean , given an example : racist white women will always called out before racist white men this isn ' t to say that it ' s not warranted contempt for white women ' s racism , it ' s to point out the fact that we hold them far more accountable than we hold the male counterpoint . and , very often , men will use this as a sort of "" justified misogyny "" -- hence white boys clinging to karen and throwing it any woman who disagrees with them .",1,train
